In order to build this codec, you need the Windows98 DDK from Microsoft. It can also work
with the Windows2000/ME DDK :

http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/
http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/ddk98.asp
http://www.microsoft.com/ddk/W2kDDK.asp

Alternatively, the required headers are also available in CYGWIN+w32api, MINGW32 or Wine :

Define ENABLE_DECODING if you want to use the decoding (alpha state, doesn't decode at the
 moment, so use it only if you plan to develop)

To release this codec you will need :
- lameACM.acm (result of the build process)
- lameACM.inf
- lame_acm.xml (where the initial configuration is stored)
