MP3 library
-----------
Version 0.2

This decoder is a 'light' version (thrown out all unnecessay parts)
from the mpg123 package. I made this for a company.

Currently only Layer III is enabled to save some space. Layer I and II isn't
tested at all. The interface will not change significantly. 
A backport to the mpg123 package is planed.

compiled and tested only on Solaris 2.6
main.c contains a simple demo application for library.
