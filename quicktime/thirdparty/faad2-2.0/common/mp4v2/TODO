Extended format (v2) support

Means to dump all possible atoms/properties with types

Wrap printf's for verbosity - see example is player/lib/http/http_util.c

Distinguish cases of no ES Config and error parsing esds

Improve error recovery when length of atom/descriptor is larger than parent/file, resync on parent.
