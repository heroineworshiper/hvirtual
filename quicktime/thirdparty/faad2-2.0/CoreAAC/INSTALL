CoreAAC build instructions
==========================


Requirements :
--------------

Visual C++ 6 (or later but there is no project file up to date)
DX SDK9 (probably compile with DX SDK8 also)
faad2 module in the FAAC CVS (http://sourceforge.net/projects/faac/)


How to compile the filter :
---------------------------

First you need to compile the DirectShow BaseClasses available in the
SDK ($DXSDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses).

Make sure you have the path to the include files and to the library in
your Visual C++ options (they must be at the top of the list).
- Include :
$DXSDK\Include
$DXSDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses\
- Library :
$DXSDK\Lib
$DXSDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses\Debug
$DXSDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses\Release

The faad2 directory must be at the same level as the CoreAAC directory.

Now you can open the project workspace CoreAAC.dsw and compile the filter.


Registering the filter :
------------------------

The filter is automatically registered with the project file provided.
If you want to register/unregister the filter manually you can use the
following commands :
To register : regsvr32 CoreAAC.ax
To unregister : regsvr32 /u CoreAAC.ax

Also some .bat files are provided :
register_release.bat
unregister_release.bat
register_debug.bat
unregister_debug.bat


Installer
---------

To create the installer you need to install NSIS
(http://nsis.sourceforge.net/)

Just right click on the file CoreAAC.nsi and select "Compile NSI".
The file Redist\CoreAAC.exe should be created.
