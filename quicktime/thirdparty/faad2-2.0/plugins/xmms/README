                       "a mp4/aac audio player for xmms"

				-------------

This source code allow to xmms to read .mp4/.m4a/.aac files

About.
 This plugin is a merge between aac and mp4 plugin. so now you could read
all new and old files encoded with different encoder and different format
(for the aac part). This is possible since the libfaad2 allow to read
old aac ADTS format.

			!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!
if at the end of some song there is a segfault (xmms going out!),
this is probably you have an old aac song encoded with an old psytel
encoder (maybe a 1.x).
This error is comming from faad2
To remove this error use psystrip.exe windows program on the file. This maybe
resolve this problem.
        -------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin was tested with the psytel encoder v2.15 and a nero encoder
