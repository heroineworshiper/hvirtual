This is LibDV, a GPL codec for DV video.  

See http://libdv.sourceforge.net/

LibDV now uses the GNU "Autotools" for building.  

BUILDING from CVS checkout
==========================

Starting with version 0.98, the libdv CVS repository does include the
configure script generated by the autotools.  Hopefully, this will
ease the pain for people who are not inclined to modify their machines
installation just to build libdv.

If you do have such desire, you can still bootstrap the build
with*:

  autoreconf -i

You should check for any fatal errors, noting that you can expect some
warnings which are harmless.


To build the libdv library and the example player:

  ./configure 
  make

The makefile generated by the autotools is very large, so the more
useful targets don't jump out at you.  Here are a few.

Build a "tar.gz" distribution file:

  make dist 

Build a rpm package file.  This requires you run as root, or you
setup your ~/.rpmmacros to allow building rpms without root:

  make rpm 

Clean up objects and binaries:

  make clean 

Clean up including files generated by autotools, which should return
the working directory state to be like it as after a CVS checkout:

  make maintainer-clean 


* Since libdv 0.103, the boostrap file is considered obsolete.  
  Autoconf now includes the program autoreconf that can serve the
  same role.



NTSC Setup/Pedestal
===================

This option has been disabled in libdv due to improper usage.

Luma and Chroma Clamping
========================

ITU-R 601 specifies that the legal range for luma is 16-235 and 
for chroma is 16-240 regardless of NTSC, PAL, or setup issues. However,
some users take advantage of the footroom or headroom below or above
these ranges to encode additional information for things such as
luma keying. The luma and chroma clamp options permit the range checking
to be disabled to preserve the superblack and superwhite.
