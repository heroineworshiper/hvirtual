.SH NAME
encodedv \- encode a series of images to a digital video stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B encodedv
[ \fBoptions\fR ] \fIvideo_pattern\fR \fI[ audio_input ]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBencodedv\fR takes a series of images in PPM/PGM/video format and
optionally an audio stream and compiles them
into a DV-encoded video stream. \fIpattern\fR specifies where the input data is
located and may be either \fI-\fR for stdin, or a \fBprintf\fR-style pattern
taking one numeric argument that gets replaced by the current frame number.
Like image%03d.ppm, which gets expanded to image000.ppm, image001.ppm, etc.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
show encodedv version number.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-start\-frame\fR=\fIcount\fR
start encoding at frame number \fIcount\fR (defaults to 0).
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-end\-frame\fR=\fIcount\fR
end encoding at frame number \fIcount\fR (defaults to unlimited).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-wrong\-interlace\fR
flip lines to compensate for wrong interlacing in the input data. Happened
with mpeg2dec generated data.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-vlc\-passes\fR
vlc code distribution passes (1-3) greater values = better quality but not 
necessarily slower encoding! This defaults for best quality = 3.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
show encoder statistics / status information
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-input\fR=\fIfilter-name\fR
Choose input-filter: [>ppm<, pgm, video]
The \fBppm\fR-filter only supports raw rgb ppm files. 
The \fBpgm\fR file format is the one generated by \fBmpeg2dec\fR of the
livid project. ( http://linuxvideo.org ) This means: Y-data appended by
U and V data which are scaled down by 2 and placed side by side. This
option defaults to PPM. Some things you want to keep in mind:

1) If you want to stream
video frames (using video_pattern = "-") you have to make sure that there 
is no trailing garbage at the end of the pictures. This is ignored by most 
image manipulation programs!

2) If you are one of the poor persons with a buggy PCI bus-mastering board
be sure to have a backup handy if you want to use video support. Some versions
of the VIA board chipsets crash your machine and even your harddisk. Since
encodedv uses full resolution capturing it is more likely to trigger these
bugs than other programs. If you have a VIA board you definitely want to
upgrade to Linux 2.4.3 or higher.

3) The encoded pictures must have the correct resolution. If they don't, you
may want to try ppmqscale. The used video format is chosen by picture 
resolution. Use 720x576 for PAL and 720x480 for NTSC.

4) If you want to speed up things a little bit and you are generating the
input pictures automatically you may want to try pgm's instead of ppm's since
they are encoded somewhat faster. But keep in mind, that this pgm format is
only optimal for PAL since NTSC averages the U and V values somewhat 
differently.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-audio\-input\fR=\fIfilter-name\fR
Choose audio-input-filter: [>none<, wav, dsp]
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fIfilter-name\fR
Choose output-filter: [>raw<]
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-static\-qno\fR=\fItable-no\fR
Static qno tables for quantisation on 2 VLC passes. 
For turbo (but somewhat lossy encoding) try -q [1,2] -p [2,3].
There are only two static qno tables registered right now:

1 : for sharp DV pictures

2 : for somewhat noisy satelite television signal

If you want to add some more, go ahead ;-)
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-fps\fR=\fIfps-number\fR
Set frames per second (default: use all frames)
.TP
\fB\-d, \fB\-\-force\-dct\fR=\fIdct-mode\fR
Force dct mode (88 or 248) for whole picture
.PP
Help Options
.TP
