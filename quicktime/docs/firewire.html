<TITLE>Quicktime for Linux</TITLE>

<H1>DV INFORMATION</H1>

Since Quicktime supports DV, the DV library was integrated.  Originally
the DV library had no front end so an abstraction to the DV library
which uses Quicktime 4 Linux semantics was also written.  The front end
to the integrated DV support is in <B>libdv.h</B><P>

<H1>THE DV_T OBJECT</H1>

It allows you to <P>

1) Decode and encode video data from a DV frame<BR>
2) Decode and encode audio data from a DV frame<P>

DV stores audio and video in each frame.  Function calls in libdv.h
handle each separately.<P>

<H1>DECODING</H1>

<B>STEP 1:</B><P>

#include "libdv.h" and create a new dv decoder.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_t *dv = dv_new();<P>
</CODE>

<B>STEP 2:</B><P>

Read a video frame from a buffer containing one frame of DV.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_read_video(dv, output_rows, data, bytes, color_model);<P>
</CODE>

<B>dv</B> is the dv decoding object.<P>

<B>output_rows</B> is an array of pointers, one pointer to each row of an
output frame.  Each row must have enough memory allocated to store a
row of the specified color model.  If the colormodel is planar, the
first three <B>output_rows</B> are the planes and the rest is ignored. 
The dimensions of the frame must be determined by whatever procedure
grabs the data from the device.<P>

<B>data</B> is the compressed data.<P>

<B>bytes</B> is the size of the compressed data.  This can be a #define from libdv.h.<P>

<B>color_model</B> is the color model to generate.  It can be almost anything
from colormodels.h but not all the outputs have been tested.<P>

<B>STEP 3:</B><P>

Read an audio frame.  This procedure only works for 2 channel 16 bit
encoding in the DV frame.  Call dv_read_audio for each frame to extract
the audio from.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_read_audio(dv, samples, data, size, channels, bits);<P>
</CODE>

<B>dv</B> is the dv pointer.<P>

<B>samples</B> is a preallocated buffer of 4096 bytes * channels *
bytes per sample, an arbitrary fraction of which are going to be
filled.<P>

<B>data</B> is the compressed DV frame.<P>

<B>size</B> is the number of bytes in the DV frame.<P>

<B>channels</B> is the number of channels libdv should store in the
<B>samples</B> buffer.  The DV format allows up to 4 audio channels. 
If the DV frame itself has more channels than the user has allocated,
they are ignored.<P>

This function returns the number of 16 bit, twos complement, native
byte order samples deposited in *samples.<P>




<B>STEP 4:</B><P>

Delete the dv object when finished reading frames.<P>

<CODE>
	dv_delete(dv);<P>
</CODE>








<H1>ENCODING</H1>

Creating and deleting the dv object is the same as in decoding.  This
involves <B>dv_new</B> and <B>dv_delete</B>.<P>

<B>ENCODING VIDEO</B><P>

<CODE><PRE>
void dv_write_video(dv_t *dv,
		unsigned char *data,
		unsigned char **input_rows,
		int color_model,
		int norm);
</PRE></CODE><P>

Compresses the uncompressed frame in <B>input_rows</B> to the
preallocated buffer pointed to by <B>data</B>.  The size of the buffer
is either <B>DV_NTSC_SIZE</B> or <B>DV_PAL_SIZE</B> depending on the
<B>norm</B>.<P>

The <B>color_model</B> can only be <B>BC_YUV422</B> or
<B>BC_RGB888</B>.<P>

The <B>norm</B> can be <B>DV_NTSC</B> or <B>DV_PAL</B>.  The norm
determines the size of the frame that must be passed to
<B>input_rows</B>.  DV_NTSC requires a 720x480 frame.  DV_PAL requires
a 720x576 frame.<P>

<B>ENCODING AUDIO</B><P>

After and only after encoding video into the frame, audio may be
encoded.<P>

<CODE><PRE>
int dv_write_audio(dv_t *dv,
		unsigned char *data,
		unsigned char *input_samples,
		int max_samples,
		int channels,
		int bits,
		int rate,
		int norm);
</PRE></CODE><P>

<B>data</B> is the same buffer previously used in the video encoding.<P>

<B>input_samples</B> is interleaved, 16 bit, twos complement, native
byte order, audio in the number of channels specified by
<B>channels</B>.<P>

<B>max_samples</B> is the number of samples in the <B>input_samples</B>
buffer.  There should be at least 4096 samples in the buffer.<P>

<B>channels</B> specifies the number of channels in the interleaved
buffer.  This matches the number of channels encoded in the DV frame. 
The DV standard allows 2 to 4 channels, depending on <B>bits</B> and
<B>rate</B>.<P>

<B>bits, rate</B> specify the encoding of the audio in the DV frame.<P>

The <B>norm</B> can be <B>DV_NTSC</B> or <B>DV_PAL</B>.<P>

This function returns the number of samples actually encoded in the
frame.  This is usually less than the <B>max_samples</B> argument but
is not constant.  It is up to the user to reuse the remaining samples
in the next frame.<P>
