<TITLE>Opening</TITLE>


<H1>Step 1: Open the file</H1>


The first step in any Quicktime operation is to open the file.  Include
the Quicktime header:<P>

<CODE>
#include &#60quicktime.h&#62
</CODE><P>

create a quicktime pointer:<P>

<CODE>
quicktime_t *file;<P>
</CODE>

and open the file in read or write mode.  The following code opens
a file in read only:<P>

<CODE>
file = quicktime_open("test.mov", 1, 0));<P>
</CODE><P>

Argument 1 is the path to a file.  Argument 2 is a flag for read
access.  Argument 3 is a flag for write access.  You can specify read
or write access by setting these flags.  Never specify read and
write.<P>

quicktime_open returns a NULL if the file couldn't be opened or the
format couldn't be recognized.  Now you can do all sorts of operations
on the file.<P>


When you're done using the file, call<P>

<CODE>
quicktime_close(quicktime_t *file);<BR>
</CODE>

In read mode call <CODE>quicktime_is_avi</CODE> to see if the file is
AVI.<P>
