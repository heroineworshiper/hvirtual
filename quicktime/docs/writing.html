<TITLE>Quicktime for Linux</TITLE>

<H1>Writing a file</H1>


The following commands are good for writing to a file.<P>

Immediately after opening the file, set up some tracks to write with
these commands:<P>

<CODE>
	quicktime_set_audio(quicktime_t *file, int channels, long sample_rate, int bits, char *compressor);<BR>
	quicktime_set_video(quicktime_t *file, int tracks, int frame_w, int frame_h, float frame_rate, char *compressor);
</CODE><P>

Don't call the audio command if you don't intend to store any audio
data.  Likewise, don't call the video command if you're just going to
save audio.<P>

Notice the channels argument for audio channels but there is no
argument for total audio tracks. Currently the library only supports
writing one audio track of any number of channels.<P>

If you intend to use the library's built-in compression routines
specify a compressor #define from quicktime.h as the compressor
argument.  If you want to write your own compression routine, specify
any 4 byte identifier you want but don't expect the library to handle
compression.  The compressor applies to all tracks of the same media
type, for sanity reasons.<P>

Once these routines are called you can optionally call <P>


<CODE>
void quicktime_set_parameter(quicktime_t *file, char *key, void *value);<P>
</CODE><P>

to set compression parameters for the codecs.  Each parameter for a
codec consists of a unique string and a pointer to a value.  The string
is unique to the codec and the parameter.  The value is in a specific
data type recognized by the parameter.<P>

To set a jpeg compression quality of 80, for example, do the following:<P>

<CODE>
int quality = 80;<BR>
quicktime_set_parameter(file, "jpeg_quality", &quality);<BR>
</CODE><P>

The data type of the value depends on the parameter.  Currently the
best way to determine what parameters and value data types a particular
codec supports is to look at the codec's source code.  A better way may
become available in the future.<P>

If you don't call quicktime_set_parameter the codecs will use default
parameters.<P>


<H2>NOTE FOR AVI FILES</H2><P>

After the above sequence and only after it, call
<CODE>quicktime_set_avi</CODE> to make the library generate an AVI
file.<P>






<A NAME="Encodingvideo">
<H1>Encoding video</H1>

The library generates compressed video frames from a frame buffer of
any colormodel in colormodels.h.  First use<P>

<CODE>
int quicktime_supported_video(quicktime_t *file, int track);
</CODE><P>

to find out if the codec for the track is in the library.  This returns
1 if it is and 0 if it isn't supported.  Then use<P>

<CODE>
int quicktime_writes_cmodel(quicktime_t *file, 
		int colormodel, 
		int track);
</CODE><P>

To query the library for a colormodel which doesn't require
downsampling to drive the codec.  <B>colormodels.h</B> contains a set
of colormodel #defines which supply the colormodel argument.  The
function returns True or False depending on whether the colormodel
argument is optimum.  When a colormodel doesn't require downsampling it
returns 1.  Then call<P>

<CODE>quicktime_set_cmodel(quicktime_t *file, int colormodel);</CODE><P>

to set the colormodel your frame buffer is in.  Finally call

<P><CODE>
	int quicktime_encode_video(quicktime_t *file, unsigned char **row_pointers, int track);
</CODE><P>


to compress the frame pointed to by **row_pointers, write it at the
current position of the track and advance the current position.  The
return value is always 1 for failure and 0 for success.  The row
pointers must point to rows stored in the colormodel.  Planar
colormodels use only the first 3 row pointers, each pointing to one of
the planes.<P>









<A NAME="Encodingaudio">
<H1>Encoding audio</H1>

The library also supports encoding certain audio codecs.  Before
writing a buffer of samples, try <P>

<CODE>
int quicktime_supported_audio(quicktime_t *file, int track);
</CODE>
<P>

The track argument is really hypothetical here, since you should only
pass 0 for it.  If you get a TRUE return value, you are free to use 

<P><CODE>
int quicktime_encode_audio(quicktime_t *file, int16_t **input_i, float **input_f, long samples);
</CODE><P>

to encode the sample buffer.  Pass an array of buffers to either the
int16_t** or the float** argument, depending on what format your data
is in.  Pass a NULL to the undesired format.  The array of buffers is
one buffer of samples for each channel.  This means all the channels
have to be written simultaneously.  The return value is 0 on success.
<P>


<A NAME="Writingrawvideo">
<H1>Writing raw video</H1>

For writing raw data, you need to supply a buffer of data exactly as
you intend the read operations to see it, with the encoding done, then
call one of these functions to write it.  For video, specify the number
of bytes in the frame buffer and the track this frame belongs to. 
Video can only be written one frame at a time.

<P><CODE>
int quicktime_write_frame(quicktime_t *file, unsigned char *video_buffer, long bytes, int track);
</CODE><P>



Now some of you are going to want to write frames directly to a file
descriptor using another library like libjpeg or something.  For every
frame start by calling quicktime_write_frame_init to initialize the
output.<P>

<CODE>
int quicktime_write_frame_init(quicktime_t *file, int track);
</CODE><P>

Then write your raw, compressed data to the file descriptor given by
quicktime_get_fd.<P>

<CODE>
FILE* quicktime_get_fd(quicktime_t *file);
</CODE><P>

End the frame by calling quicktime_write_frame_end.<P>

<CODE>
int quicktime_write_frame_end(quicktime_t *file, int track);
</CODE><P>

Repeat starting at quicktime_write_frame_init for every frame.

<A NAME="Writingkeyframes">
<H1>Writing Keyframes</H1>

Quicktime offers very simple support for keyframes: a table of all the
keyframe numbers in a track.  Many students think there's a massive
keyframe programming language in Quicktime.  Really all there is is a
table.<P>

There are two things you can with the keyframe table: insert keyframe
numbers and retrieve keyframe numbers.<P>

<CODE>
void quicktime_insert_keyframe(quicktime_t *file, long frame, int track)
</CODE>
<P>

Inserts a keyframe number corresponding to the <B>frame</B> argument in
the table.<P>

<A NAME="Encodingrawaudio">
<H1>Writing raw audio data</H1>

This functionality is obsolete due to the idiosyncracies in compressed
audio handling.  If you want to write uncompressed audio, use the
<B>twos</B> codec.<P>

When you're done, call quicktime_close to close the file.<P>

<CODE>
int quicktime_close(file);
</CODE>
