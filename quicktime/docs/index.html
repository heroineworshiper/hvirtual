Quicktime movies are first and foremost a very sophisticated wrapper
for 3rd party compression schemes.  While not an officially sanctioned
Microsoft standard, it is well documented and pretty consistent.  Once
a codec works in Quicktime, you can be sure it'll always work.  With
Microsoft standards, the codec usage constantly changes over time.<P>

Quicktime for Linux hides the structure of a Quicktime movie and gives
the programmer a set of audio and video streams with some compression
ability.  The audio tracks are presented as sequential streams of PCM
audio data and video tracks are a sequential streams of frames.<P>

Before you quit your day job and write up your dream program on this be
aware of some limitations.  Quicktime for Linux is slowly increasing in
functionality but is always going to be better at uncompressed streams
than anything else.<P>

This library doesn't give you the official Quicktime API.  That was way
too complicated and covered more than we needed.  Instead it uses a
proprietary C interface.<P>

The library doesn't include any commercial codecs or compressed header
support.  Compressed header support may come in a later version.<P>

There is growing support for McRosoft AVI.  This format is lousy at
uncompressed streams and not consistent so the AVI support is mainly
for karma.<P>

What you can do is create and read any Quicktime movie using certain
compression formats.  You can still access raw data if you want to
write your own compression routines.<P>

Quicktime for Linux doesn't use <B>plugins</B> to achieve
functionality.  The library is always updated more frequently than the
codecs.  Plugins are more convenient when the library is only available
on hard media or requires upgrade licenses for every download, which it
doesn't.<P>
