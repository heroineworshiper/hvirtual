@chapter USING EFFECTS

It would be sufficient to perform all changes to the timeline using
editing operations, but this isn't very extensible.  Certain timeline
changes should produce a different effect in the output without
involving a unique procedure to apply each change.  This is why we have
effects.

Effects fall into three categories, and each effect in a category is
applied using the same procedure.

@node REALTIME EFFECTS
@section REALTIME EFFECTS

These are layered under the track they apply to.  They process the
track when the track is played back, with no permanent storage of the
output except when the project is rendered.

@b{APPLYING REALTIME EFFECTS}

All the realtime effects are listed in the resource window, divided
into two groups: audio effects and video effects.  Audio effects should
be dragged from the resource window onto audio tracks.  Video effects
should be dragged onto video tracks.

If there is data on the destination track, the effect is applied to the
entire track.  If there is no data on the track the effect is deleted. 
Finally, if a region of the track is selected the effect is pasted into
the region, regardless of whether there is data.

Some of the effects don't process data but synthesize data.  In the
case of a synthesis effect, you'll want to select a region of the
track so the dragging operation pastes it without deleting it.

When dragging more than one effect onto a track, you'll see the effects
layering from top to bottom, on the bottom of the track.   When the
track is played back, effects are processed from top to bottom.  The
output of the top effect becomes the input of the bottom effect and so
on and so forth.

In addition to dragging from the resource window, there are 2 other
methods of applying them:

@itemize
@item
@b{APPLYING FROM THE TRACK POPUP MENU:}

Right click on a track and select @b{Attach effect} from the popup.  The attach effect
dialog gives you more control than pure dragging and dropping.  For one
thing, the attach effect dialog lets you attach two more types of
effects: shared effects and shared tracks.  Select a plugin from the
@b{Plugins} column and hit @b{Attach} under the plugins column to attach
it.  The effect is the same as if the effect was dragged from the
resource window.

@item
@b{APPLYING FROM THE AUDIO AND VIDEO MENUS:}

Select @b{Audio->Attach effect...} or @b{Video->Attach effect} to attach
a realtime effect to all the recordable tracks simultaneously.  The
advantage with this is most of the time you want to attach the same
effect to all the audio tracks and the other two methods require
repeating the same work for every track.

The menu interface has an option called  @b{Attach single standalone and
share others}.  Enable this to make the first track get a standalone
effect and to have the other tracks share the standalone effect.  Most
of the time, you want this to be on.

@end itemize


When an effect exists under a track, it most often needs to be
configured.  Go to the effect and right click on it to bring up the
effect popup.  In the effect popup is a @b{show} option.  The show
option causes the GUI for the effect to appear under the cursor.  Most
effects have GUI's but some don't.  If the effect doesn't have a GUI,
nothing pops up when the @b{show} option is selected.  When you
tweek parameters in the effect GUI, the parameters normally effect the
entire duration of the effect.

@node REALTIME EFFECT TYPES
@subsection REALTIME EFFECT TYPES

The two other effect types supported by the Attach Effect dialog are
recycled effects.  In order to use a recycled effect, three requiremenets
must be met:

@itemize

@item
There must be other effects in the timeline.

@item

The other effects must be of the same type as the track you're
attaching an effect to.  If the track is an audio track, the effects
must be audio effects.  If the track is a video track, the effects must
be video effects.

@item

The insertion point or selected region must start inside the other effects.

@end itemize

In the case of a shared effect, these conditions must be true.  In the
case of a shared track, there merely must be another track on the
timeline of the same type as the track you're applying an effect to. 
If you right clicked on a video track to attach an effect, there won't
be anything in the @b{shared tracks} column if no other video track
exists.  If you right clicked on an audio track there won't be anything
in the shared track column if no other audio track exists.

If shared effects or shared tracks are available, they appear in the
@b{shared effects} and @b{shared tracks} columns.  The
@b{attach} button under each column causes anything highlighted in
the column to be attached under the current track.

Shared effects and shared tracks allow very unique things to be done. 
In the case of a shared effect, the shared effect is treated like a
copy of the original effect except in the shared effect the GUI can't
be brought up.  All configuration of the shared effect is determined by
the GUI of the original effect and only the GUI of the original effect
can be brought up.

When a shared effect is played back, it's processed just like a normal
effect except the configuration is copied from the original effect. 
Some effects detect when they are being shared, like the reverb effects
and the compressor.  These effects determine what tracks are sharing
them and either mix the two tracks together or use one track to stage
some value.  The reverb mixes tracks together to simulate ambience. 
The compressor uses one of the sharing tracks as the trigger.

When an original track has a @b{shared track} as one of its effects,
the shared track itself is used as a realtime effect.  This is more
commonly known as @b{bouncing tracks} but Cinelerra achieves the
same operation by attaching shared tracks.  The fade and any effects in
the shared track are applied to the original track.  Once the shared
track has processed the data, the original track performs any effects
which come below the shared track and then composites it on the output.

In addition, once the shared track has processed the output of the
original track like a realtime effect, the shared track mixes itself
into the output with it's settings for pan, mode, and projector.  Thus,
two tracks are mixing the same data on the output.  Most of the time
you don't want the shared track to mix the same data as the original
track on the output.  You want it to stop right before the mixing stage
and give the data back to the original track.  Do this by enabling the
@image{mutepatch_up} mute toggle next to each track for whom you don't
want to mix on the output.

Suppose you were making video and you did want the shared track to
composite the original track's data on the output a second time.  In
the case of video, the video from the shared track would always appear
under the video from the original track, regardless of whether it was
on top of the original track.  This is because shared tracks are
composited in order of their attachment.  Since it's part of the original
track it has to be composited before the original track is composited.







@node EDITING REALTIME EFFECTS
@subsection EDITING REALTIME EFFECTS

Many operations exist for manipulating effects once they are in the
timeline.  Because mixing effects and media is such complex business,
the methods used in editing effects aren't as concise as cutting and
pasting.  Some of the editing happens by dragging in/out points, some
of the editing happens through popup menus, and some of it happens by
dragging effects.

Normally when you edit tracks, the effects follow the editing
decisions.  If you cut from a track, the effect shrinks.  If you drag
edit in/out points, the effect changes length.  This behavior can be
disabled by selecting @b{Settings->edit effects} in the project
window.  This decouples effects from editing operations, but what if
you just want to edit the effects?

Move the timeline cursor over the effect borders until it changes to a
resize left or resize right icon.  In this state, if you drag the end
of the effect, it performs an edit just like dragging the end of a
track does.  

The three editing behaviors of track trimming apply to effect trimming
and they are bound to the mouse buttons that you set in @b{interface
preferences}. @xref{INTERFACE}.  When you perform a trim edit on an
effect, the effect boundary is moved by dragging on it.  Unlike track
editing, the effect has no source length.  You can extend the end of an
effect as much as desired without being limited.

Also unlike track editing, the starting position of the drag operation
doesn't bind the edit decision to media.  The media the effect is bound
to doesn't follow effect edits.  Other effects; however, do follow
editing decisions made on an effect.  If you drag the end of an effect
which is lined up to effects on other tracks, the effects on the other
tracks will be edited while the media stays the same.

What happens if you trim the end of an effect in, leaving a lot of
unaffected time near the end of the track?  When you drag an effect in
from the Resource Window you can insert the effect in the portion of
the row unoccupied by the trimming operation.  Realtime effects are
organized into rows under the track.  Each row can have multiple
effects.

In some cases you'll want a trimming operation to change only one row
of effects.  This can be achieved by first positioning the insertion
point on the start or end of the effect.  Then press @b{shift} while
beginning the trimming operation.  This causes the operation to change
only one row of effects.

In addition to trimming, you can move effects up or down.  Every track
can have a stack of effects under it.  By moving an effect up or down
you change the order in which effects are processed in the stack.  Go
to an effect and right click to bring up the effect menu.  The
@b{Move up} and @b{Move down} options move the effect up or down.

When you're moving effects up or down, be aware that if they're shared
as @b{shared effects}, any references will be pointing to a
different effect after the move operation.

Finally, there's dragging of effects.  Dragging effects works just like
dragging edits.  You must select the @image{arrow} arrow to enter drag and
drop mode before dragging effects.  The effects snap to media
boundaries, effect boundaries, and tracks.  Be aware if you drag a
reference to a shared effect, the reference will usually point to the
wrong effect afterwards.

Right click on an effect to bring up a menu for the effect.  Select
@b{attach...} to change the effect or change the reference if it is
a shared effect.








@node RENDERED EFFECTS
@section RENDERED EFFECTS


Another type of effect is performed on a section of the track and the
result stored somewhere before it is played back.  The result is
usually pasted into the track to replace the original data.

In 15 years, the only effect we actually ever rendered with this feature
was @b{normalize}.  We've never rendered an effect which could be
applied on the timeline, even though this feature supports rendering
realtime effects.

This feature was implemented back when computers were too slow to play
back anything in realtime.  Decent sounding reverb took a long time &
was considered major number crunching.

The rendered effects are not listed in the resource window but instead
are accessed through the @b{Audio->Render effect} and
@b{Video->Render effect} menu options.  Each of these menu options
brings up a dialog for the rendered effect.  Rendered effects apply to
only one type of track, either audio or video.  If no tracks of the
type exist, an error pops up.

A region of the timeline to apply the effect to must be defined before
selecting @b{Render effect...}.  If no in/out points and no
highlighted region exists, the entire region after the insertion point
is treated as the affected region.  Otherwise, the region between the
in/out points or the highlighted region is the affected region.

Secondly, the tracks to apply the rendered affect to need to be
@b{armed}.  All other tracks are ignored.

Finally, the rendered affect processes certain track attributes when it
reads its input data but not others.  Transitions in the affected track
are applied.  Nudge is not and effects are not.  This allows the new
data to be pasted into the existing position without changing the nudge
value.

In the render effect dialog is a list of all the realtime and all the
rendered effects.  The difference here is that the realtime effects are
rendered to disk and not applied under the track.  Highlight an effect
in the list to designate it as the one being performed.

Define a file to render the effect to in the @b{Select a file to
render to} box.  The @image{magnify} magnifying glass allows file
selection from a list.

Select a file format which can handle the track type.  The
@image{wrench} wrench allows configuration specific to the file format.

There is also an option for creating a new file at each label.  If you
have a CD rip on the timeline which you want to divide into different
files, the labels would become dividing points between the files if
this option were selected.  When the timeline is divided by labels, the
effect is re-initialized at every label.  Normalize operations take the
peak in the current file and not in the entire timeline.

Finally there is an insertion strategy just like in the render dialog. 
It should be noted that even though the effect applies only to audio or
video, the insertion strategy applies to all tracks just like a
clipboard operation.

When you click @b{OK} in the effect dialog, it calls the GUI of the
effect.  If the effect is also a realtime effect, a second GUI appears
to prompt for acceptance or rejection of the current settings.  After
accepting the settings, the effect is processed.














@node TRANSITIONS
@section TRANSITIONS

When one edit ends and another edit begins, the default behaviour is to
have the first edit's output immediately become the output of the
second edit when played back.  Transitions are a way for the first
edit's output to become the second edit's output with different
variations.

Cinelerra supports audio and video transitions, all of which are listed
in the resource window.  Transitions may only apply to the matching
track type.  Transitions under @b{audio transitions} can only apply
to audio tracks.  Transitions under @b{video transitions} can only
apply to video tracks.

Load a video file and cut a section from the center so the edit point
is visible on the timeline.  Go the resource window and click on the
@b{Video transitions} folder.  Drag a transition from the transition
list onto the second video edit on the timeline.  A box highlights over
where the transition will appear.  Releasing it over the second edit
applies the transition between the first and second edit.

You can now scrub over the transition with the transport controls and
watch the output in the @b{Compositor window}.  Scrubbing with the
insertion point doesn't normally show transitions because the
transition durations are usually too short.  The exact point in time
when the transition takes effect isn't straightforward.  It starts when
the second edit begins and lasts a certain amount of time into the
second edit.  Therefore, the first asset needs to have enough data
after the edit point to fill the transition into the second edit.

Once the transition is in place, it can be edited similarly to an
effect.  Move the pointer over the transition and right click to bring
up the transition menu.  The @b{show} option brings up specific
parameters for the transition in question if there are any.  The
@b{length} option adjusts the length of the transition in seconds. 
Once these two parameters are set, they are applied to future
transitions until they are changed again.  Finally, the @b{detach}
option removes the transition from the timeline.

Dragging and dropping transitions from the Resource window to the
Program window can be really slow and tiring.  Fortunately, once you
drag a transition from the Resource window, the @b{U} and @b{u}
keys will paste the same transition.  The @b{U} key pastes the last
video transition and the @b{u} key pastes the last audio transition
on all the recordable tracks.  If the insertion point or in point is
over an edit, the beginning of the edit is covered by the transition.  

It should be noted that when playing transitions from the timeline to a
hardware accelerated video device, the hardware acceleration will
usually be turned off momentarily during the transition and on after
the transition in order to render the transition.  Using an
unaccelerated video device for the entire timeline normally removes the
disturbance.





@node LADSPA EFFECTS
@section LADSPA EFFECTS


LADSPA effects are supported in realtime and rendered mode for audio. 
The LADSPA plugins you get from the internet vary in quality.  Most
can't be tweeked in realtime very easily and work better when
rendered.  Some crash and some can only be applied to one track due to
a lack of reentrancy.  Although Cinelerra implements the LADSPA
interface as accurately as possible, multiple tracks of realtime,
simultaneous processing go beyond the majority of LADSPA users.  LADSPA
effects appear in the audio folder as the hammer and screwdriver, to
signify that they are Plugins for Linux Audio Developers.

LADSPA Effects are enabled merely by setting the @b{LADSPA_PATH}
environment variable to the location of your LADSPA plugins or putting
them in the @b{/usr/lib/cinelerra} directory.





@node EFFECT PRESETS
@section EFFECT PRESETS

Save and recall all the settings for an effect by using the @b{presets}
window.  Bring up the effect context menu by right clicking on the
effect on the timeline.  Go to @b{Presets...} to bring up the window. 
Save all the settings to a preset by entering a title in @b{Preset
title} and clicking @b{save}.  Recall the settings in a preset by
highlighting it and clicking @b{Apply}.  Delete a preset by highlighting
it and clicking @b{Delete}.
