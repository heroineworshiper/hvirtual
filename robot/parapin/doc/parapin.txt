                                 Introduction
                                       
   parapin makes it easy to write C code under Linux that controls
   individual pins on a PC parallel port. This kind of control is very
   useful for electronics projects that use the PC's parallel port as a
   generic digital I/O interface. Parapin goes to great lengths to
   insulate the programmer from the somewhat complex parallel port
   programming interface provided by the PC hardware, making it easy to
   use the parallel port for digital I/O. By the same token, this
   abstraction also makes Parapin less useful in applications that need
   to actually use the parallel port as a parallel port (e.g., for
   talking to a printer).
   
   Parapin has two ``personalities'': it can either be used as a
   user-space C library, or linked as part of a Linux kernel module. The
   user and kernel personalities were both written with efficiency in
   mind, so that Parapin can be used in time-sensitive applications.
   Using Parapin should be very nearly as fast as writing directly to the
   parallel port registers manually.
   
   Parapin provides a simple interface that lets programs use pins of the
   PC parallel port as digital inputs or outputs. Using this interface,
   it is easy to assert high or low TTL logic values on output pins or
   poll the state of input pins. Some pins are bidirectional--that is,
   they can be switched between input and output modes on the fly.
   
   Parapin was written by Jeremy Elson (jelson@circlemud.org) while at
   the University of Southern California's Information Sciences
   Institute. This work was supported by DARPA under grant No.
   DABT63-99-1-0011 as part of the SCADDS project, and was also made
   possible in part due to support from Cisco Systems. It is freely
   available under the GNU Public License (GPL). Up-to-date information
   about Parapin, including the latest version of the software, can be
   found at the Parapin Home Page.
   
   Warning:
   
   Attaching custom electronics to your PC using the parallel port as a
   digital I/O interface can damage both the PC and the electronics if
   you make a mistake. If you're using high voltage electronics, a
   mistake can also cause serious personal injury. Be careful.
   
   If possible, use a parallel port that is on an ISA card, instead of
   one integrated onto the motherboard, to minimize the expense of
   replacing a parallel port controller that you destroy.
   
   USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
   
                                       
                         Parallel Port Specifications
                                       
   This section will briefly outline some of the basic electrical
   operating characteristics of a PC parallel port. More detail can be
   found in the IBM Parallel Port FAQ, written by Zhahai Stewart, or the
   PC Parallel Port Mini-FAQ by Kris Heidenstrom. Those documents have a
   lot of detail about registers, bit numbers, and inverted logic--those
   topics won't be discussed here, because the entire point of Parapin is
   to let programmers control the port without knowing those gory
   details.
   
   The PC parallel port usually consists of 25 pins in a DB-25 connector.
   These pins can interface to the TTL logic of an external device,
   either as inputs or outputs. Some pins can be used as inputs only,
   while some can be switched in software, on-the-fly, between input mode
   and output mode. Note, however, that it can be dangerous for two
   devices to assert an output value on the same line at the same time.
   Devices that are using bidirectional pins must agree (somehow) on who
   is supposed to control the line at any given time.
   
   From the point of view of Parapin, the pinout of the parallel port is
   as follows:
   
   Pin Direction
   1 In/Out
   2-9 In/Out (see note)
   10 Input, Interrupt Generator
   11 Input
   12 Input
   13 Input
   14 In/Out
   15 Input
   16 In/Out
   17 In/Out
   18-25 Ground
   
   Pins 2-9--called the parallel port's ``Data Pins''--are ganged. That
   is, their directions are not individually controllable; they must be
   either all inputs or all outputs. (The actual values of the pins--on
   or off--are individually controllable.) Also, some of the oldest
   parallel ports do not support switching between inputs and outputs on
   pins 2-9 at all, so pins 2-9 are always outputs. Many PC motherboards
   allow the user to select the personality of the parallel port in the
   BIOS. If you need to use pins 2-9 as bidirectional or input pins, make
   sure your port is configured as a ``PS/2'' port or one of the other
   advanced port types; ports in SPP (Standard Parallel Port) mode may
   not support direction switching on pins 2-9.
   
   Pin 10 is special because it can generate interrupts. Interrupt
   handling is discussed in more detail in Section 9.
   
   Output pins can assert either a TTL high value (between +2.4v and
   +5.0v), or a TTL low (between 0v and +0.8v). The port can not source
   much current. Specs for different implementations vary somewhat, but a
   safe assumption (staying within spec) is that the voltage will be at
   least 2.5v when drawing up to 2.5mA. In reality you can sometimes get
   away with using an output pin to power a component that uses 3v or
   even 5v logic, but the supplied voltage may sag if more than 2.5mA is
   drawn. Input pins are typically spec'ed to be able to sink up to about
   20mA. For a more detailed treatment of the parallel port electronics,
   see the references above.
   
                                       
                                Parapin Basics
                                       
   Parapin has two personalities: one for plain user-space operation
   (i.e., linking Parapin with a regular C program), and one for use with
   Linux kernel modules. The two personalities differ in how they are
   compiled (Section 4) and initialized (Section 5). Also, only the
   kernel version is capable of servicing parallel-port interrupts that
   are generated from Pin 10. Otherwise, the two personalities are the
   same.
   
   The user-space library version of Parapin works very much like any
   other C library. However, kernel programming differs from user-space
   programming in many important ways; these details are far beyond the
   scope of this document. The best reference I've ever found is
   Alessandro Rubini's fantastic book, Linux Device Drivers. Go buy it
   from your favorite technical bookstore; or, if you don't have a
   favorite, use my favorite: BookPool. If you don't want to buy the
   book, a far inferior alternative (but better than nothing) is the free
   Linux Kernel Hacker's Guide.
   
   In Parapin, there are five basic operations possible:
   
     * Initialize the library (Section 5)
     * Put pins into input or output mode (Section 6)
     * Set the state of output pins--i.e., high/set or low/clear
       (Section 7)
     * Poll the state of input pins (Section 8)
     * Handle interrupts (Section 9)
       
   Each of these functions will be discussed in later sections.
   
   Most of the functions take a pins argument--a single integer that is
   actually a bitmap representing the set of pins that are being changed
   or queried. Parapin's header file, parapin.h, defines a number of
   constants of the form ``LP_PINnn'' that applications should use to
   specify pins. The nn represents the pin number, ranging from 01 to 17.
   For example, the command
        set_pin(LP_PIN05);

   turns on pin number 5 (assuming that pin is configured as an output
   pin; the exact semantics of set_pin are discussed in later sections).
   C's logical-or operator can be used to combine multiple pins into a
   single argument, so
        set_pin(LP_PIN02 | LP_PIN14 | LP_PIN17);

   turns on pins 2, 14, and 17.
   
   Usually, it is most convenient to use #define statements to give pins
   logical names that have meaning in the context of your application.
   The documentation of most ICs and other electronics gives names to I/O
   pins; using those names makes the most sense. For example, a National
   Semiconductor ADC0831 Analog-to-Digital converter has four I/O pins
   called VCC (the supply voltage), CS (chip select), CLK (clock), and D0
   (data output 0). A fragment of code to control this chip might look
   something like this:
        #include "parapin.h"

        #define VCC LP_PIN02
        #define CS  LP_PIN03
        #define CLK LP_PIN04
        #define D0  LP_PIN10 /* input pin */
        ...
        clear_pin(CS);  /* pull Chip Select low, tell it to acquire */
        ...
        set_pin(CLK);   /* clock it */
        clear_pin(CLK);

   This method has a number of advantages. First, it makes the code more
   readable to someone who has the ADC0831 documentation in hand. Second,
   the #define statements summarize the mappings of IC pins to parallel
   port pins, making it easier to build the physical interface. Also, if
   the physical interface changes, the #defines make it easy to remap
   parallel port pins to new IC pins.
   
   Parapin's header file also provides these constants in an array called
   LP_PIN. This array is useful in some contexts where the pin number is
   being specified with a variable instead of a constant. For example:
        /* runway lights: light up pins 1 through 9 in sequence */
        while (1) {
                for (i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
                        set_pin(LP_PIN[i]);
                        usleep(200);
                        clear_pin(LP_PIN[i]);
                }
        }

   Code such as the above fragment would be much more complex if the
   programmer were forced to use constants. There is a direct
   correspondence between indices in the array and pin numbers;
   accordingly, only indices from 1 to 17 should be used. Programs should
   never reference LP_PIN[0] or LP_PIN[i] where i > 17.
   
                                       
                             Compiling and Linking
                                       
The C Library Version

   The user-space version of Parapin is compiled and linked very much
   like any other C library. If you installed Parapin on your system
   using ``make install'', the library (libparapin.a) was probably
   installed in /usr/local/lib. The header file with the library's
   function prototypes and other definitions, parapin.h, is probably also
   in /usr/local/include.
   
   Note well: Parapin must be compiled with gcc using compiler
   optimization of -O or better. This is because Parapin uses the inb and
   outb functions that exist only with compiler optimization.
   
   To use the library, first make sure to #include parapin.h in your C
   source file. When linking, add -lparapin along with any other
   libraries you might be using.
   
The Kernel Module Version

   As with the C library version, kernel source code that uses Parapin
   must #include parapin.h. Make sure that __KERNEL__ is defined before
   the include statement.
   
   Note well: Parapin must be compiled with gcc using compiler
   optimization of -O or better. This is because Parapin uses the inb and
   outb functions that exist only with compiler optimization.
   
   Linking is a little more complicated. As with any other interdependent
   kernel modules, there are actually two ways of using parapin with your
   Linux device driver:
     * Compile Parapin independently, insert it into the kernel as its
       own module using insmod, and then insert your driver separately
       using a different insmod command. In this case, insmod and the
       kernel resolve the links between your driver and Parapin's
       functions.
     * Compile Parapin right into your device driver, so that the entire
       thing is inserted with a single insmod command. This can be less
       confusing for users if you're distributing your device driver to
       other people because it eliminates the extra step of finding,
       compiling, and inserting a separate module. On the other hand, it
       will cause conflicts if a user tries to insert two different
       modules that use Parapin at the same time.
       
   The Makefile that comes with Parapin compiles Parapin into its own
   independent module, called kparapin.o. This module can be inserted
   into the kernel using insmod (as described in the first method). If
   you'd rather use the second method, and link Parapin directly with
   your device driver module instead, do the following:
   
    1. Copy parapin.c into your driver's source directory.
    2. In your driver's Makefile, compile kparapin.o from parapin.c, with
       the -D__KERNEL__ directive, but without the -DMODULE directive.
    3. Link kparapin.o with all the other object files that make up your
       driver.
       
   If your driver only consists of one other source file, and you have
   never linked multiple .o's together into a single kernel module, it's
   easy. First, compile each .c file into a .o using gcc -c (the same as
   with normal C programs that span multiple source files); then, link
   all the .o's together into one big .o using ld -i -o final-driver.o
   component1.o component2.o component3.o ....
   
   Important note: Whichever method you use, Parapin also requires
   functions provided by the standard Linux kernel module parport. Make
   sure you insert the parport module before inserting any modules that
   use Parapin; otherwise, you will get unresolved symbols.
   
                                       
                          Initialization and Shutdown
                                       
   Before any other Parapin functions can be used, the library must be
   initialized. Parapin will fail ungracefully if any functions are
   called before its initialization. This is because the library's other
   functions do not check that the library is in a sane state before
   doing their jobs. This was an intentional design decision because the
   maximum possible efficiency is required in many applications that
   drive the parallel port at high speeds. My goal was for Parapin to be
   almost as fast as directly writing to registers.
   
   The exact initialization method varies, depending on if Parapin is
   being used as a C library or as a kernel module.
   
The C Library Version

   C library initialization is performed using the function
        int pin_init_user(int lp_base);

   whose single argument, lp_base, specifies the base I/O address of the
   parallel port being controlled. Common values of lp_base are 0x378 for
   LPT1, or 0x278 for LPT2; parapin.h defines the constants LPT1 and LPT2
   to these values for convenience. However, the exact port address may
   vary depending on the configuration of your computer. If you're
   unsure, the BIOS status screen displayed while the computer boots
   usually shows the base addresses of all detected parallel ports.
   
   Programs using Parapin must be running as root when they are
   initialized. Initialization of the library will fail if the process is
   owned by any user other than the super-user because Parapin has to
   request the right to write directly to hardware I/O registers using
   the ioperm function. The security-conscious programmer is encouraged
   to drop root privileges using setuid after a successful call to
   pin_init_user.
   
   The return value of pin_init_user will be 0 if initialization is
   successful, or -1 if there is an error. Applications must not call
   other Parapin functions if initialization fails. Failed initialization
   is usually because the program is not running as root.
   
   No shutdown function needs to be called in the C library version of
   Parapin.
   
The Kernel Module Version

   Initialization and shutdown in the kernel flavor of Parapin is done
   using the following two functions:
        int pin_init_kernel(int lpt,
                            void (*irq_func)(int, void *, struct pt_regs *));
        void pin_release();

   The first function is not as intimidating as it looks. Its first
   argument, lpt, is the parallel port number that you want to control.
   The number references the kernel's table of detected parallel ports; 0
   is the first parallel port and is a safe guess as a default.
   
   The second argument, irq_func, is a pointer to a callback function to
   be used for servicing interrupts generated by the parallel port. This
   argument may be NULL if the driver does not need to handle interrupts.
   Details about interrupt handling are discussed in Section 9.
   
   pin_init_kernel will return 0 on success, or a number less than 0 on
   error. The return value will be a standard errno value such as
   -ENODEV, suitable for passing up to higher layers. If Parapin
   initialization fails, the driver must not call Parapin's other
   functions. As described earlier, this requirement is not enforced for
   efficiency reasons.
   
   When a driver is finished controlling the parallel port using Parapin,
   it must call pin_release. The state of the parallel port's
   interrupt-enable bit will be restored to the state it was in at the
   time pin_init_kernel was originally called.
   
   Parapin's pin_init_kernel and pin_release functions work with the
   Linux kernel's standard parport facility; as noted above, the parport
   module must be loaded along with any module that uses Parapin. When
   initialized, Parapin will register itself as a user of the parallel
   port, and claim exclusive access to that port. This means no other
   processes will be allowed to use the parallel port until pin_release
   is called.
   
                                       
                     Configuring Pins as Inputs or Outputs
                                       
   As shown in the table in Section 2, most of the pins on modern
   parallel ports can be configured as either inputs or outputs. When
   Parapin is initialized, it is safest to assume that the state of all
   these switchable pins is undefined. That is, they must be explicitly
   configured as outputs before values are asserted, or configured as
   inputs before they are queried.
   
   As mentioned earlier, Pins 2-9 can not be configured independently.
   They are always in the same mode: either all input or all output.
   Configuring any pin in that range has the effect of configuring all of
   them. The constant LP_DATA_PINS is an alias that refers to all the
   pins in this range (2-9).
   
   The other switchable pins (Pins 1, 14, 16, and 17) may be
   independently configured. Pins 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 are always
   inputs and can not be configured.
   
   It is also worth reiterating that having two devices both try to
   assert (output) a value on the same pin at the same time can be
   dangerous. The results are undefined and are often dependent on the
   exact hardware implementation of your particular parallel port. This
   situation should be avoided. The protocol spoken between the PC and
   the external device you're controlling to should always agree who is
   asserting a value on a pin and who is reading that pin as an input.
   
   Pins are configured using one of the following three functions:
        void pin_input_mode(int pins);
        void pin_output_mode(int pins);
        void pin_mode(int pins, int mode);

   The pins argument of all three functions accepts the LP_PINnn
   constants described in Section 3. The pin_mode function is just
   provided for convenience; it does the same thing as the pin_input and
   pin_output functions. Its mode argument takes one of the two constants
   LP_INPUT or LP_OUTPUT. Calling pin_mode(pins, LP_INPUT) is exactly the
   same as calling pin_input(pins).
   
   Examples:
        pin_input_mode(LP_PIN01);
        /* Pin 1 is now an input */

        pin_output_mode(LP_PIN14 | LP_PIN16);
        /* Pins 14 and 16 are now outputs */

        pin_mode(LP_PIN02, LP_INPUT);
        /* Pins 2 through 9 are now ALL inputs */

        pin_mode(LP_PIN01 | LP_PIN02, LP_OUTPUT);
        /* Pin 1, and Pins 2-9 are ALL outputs */

        pin_input_mode(LP_DATA_PINS);
        /* The constant LP_DATA_PINS is an alias for Pins 2-9 */

                                       
                           Setting Output Pin States
                                       
   Once Parapin has been initialized (Section 5), and pins have been
   configured as output pins (Section 6), values can be asserted on those
   pins using the following functions:
        void set_pin(int pins);
        void clear_pin(int pins);
        void change_pin(int pins, int state);

   The pins argument of all three functions accepts the LP_PINnn
   constants described in Section 3. set_pin turns pins on, electrically
   asserting high TTL values. clear_pin turns pins off, electrically
   asserting low TTL values. The convenience function change_pin does the
   same thing as set_pin and clear_pin; its state argument takes one of
   the constants LP_SET or LP_CLEAR. Calling change_pin(pins, LP_SET) has
   exactly the same effect as calling set_pin(pins).
   
   These three functions will only have effects on pins that were
   previously configured as output pins as described in Section 6.
   Attempting to assert a value on an input pin will have no effect.
   
   Note that while the direction of Pins 2-9 must be the same at all
   times (i.e., either all input or all output), the actual values of
   these pins are individually controllable when they are in output mode.
   
   Examples:
        pin_output_mode(LP_PIN01|LP_DATA_PINS|LP_PIN14|LP_PIN16|LP_PIN17);
        /* All these pins are now in output mode */

        set_pin(LP_PIN01 | LP_PIN04 | LP_PIN07 | LP_PIN14 | LP_PIN16);
        /* Pins 1, 4, 7, 14, and 16 are all on */

        clear_pin(LP_PIN01 | LP_PIN16);
        /* Pins 1 and 16 are now off */

        change_pin(LP_PIN01 | LP_PIN02, some_integer ? LP_SET : LP_CLEAR);
        /* Pins 1 and 2 are now off if and only if some_integer == 0 */

                                       
                              Polling Input Pins
                                       
   Once Parapin has been initialized (Section 5), and pins have been
   configured as input pins (Section 6), the value being asserted by the
   ``far end'' can be queried using the following function:
        int pin_is_set(int pins);

   Any number of pins can be queried simultaneously. The pins argument
   accepts the LP_PINnn constants described in Section 3. The return
   value is an integer in the same format. Any pins that are set
   (electrically high) will be set in the return value; pins that are
   clear (electrically low) will be clear in the return value.
   
   Pins may only be queried if:
     * They are permanent input pins (Pins 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15), as
       described in Section 2, or
     * They are bidirectional pins previously configured as input pins,
       as described in Section 6.
       
   Any query to an output pin will always return a value indicating that
   the pin is clear. In other words, this function can not be used to
   determine what value was previously asserted to an output pin.
   
   Examples:
        pin_input_mode(LP_PIN01 | LP_DATA_PINS | LP_PIN17);
        /* Pins 1, 2-9, and 17 are now in input mode, along with
           Pins 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15, which are always inputs */

        /* check the state of pin 1 */
        printf("Pin 1 is %s!\n", pin_is_set(LP_PIN01) ? "on" : "off");

        /* check pins 2, 5, 10, and 17 - demonstrating a multiple query */
        int result = pin_is_set(LP_PIN02 | LP_PIN05 | LP_PIN10 | LP_PIN17);

        if (!result)
                printf("Pins 2, 5, 10 and 17 are all off\n");
        else {
                if (result & LP_PIN02)
                        printf("Pin 2 is high!\n");
                if (result & LP_PIN05)
                        printf("Pin 5 is high!\n");
                if (result & LP_PIN10)
                        printf("Pin 10 is high!\n");
                if (result & LP_PIN17)
                        printf("Pin 17 is high!\n");
        }

                                       
                           Interrupt (IRQ) Handling
                                       
   The kernel-module version of Parapin lets parallel port drivers catch
   interrupts generated by devices connected to the parallel port. Most
   hardware generates interrupts on the rising edge1 of the input to Pin
   10.
   
   Before Parapin's interrupt-handling can be used, the Linux kernel
   itself must be configured to handle parallel port interrupts. Unlike
   most other hardware devices, the kernel does not detect or claim the
   parallel port's interrupts by default. It is possible to manually
   enable kernel IRQ handling for the parallel port by writing the
   interrupt number into the special file /proc/parport/[IMAGE png]/irq,
   where [IMAGE png] is the parallel port number. For example, the
   following command tells the kernel that parport0 is using IRQ 7:
        echo 7 > /proc/parport/0/irq

   If parallel port support is being provided to the kernel through
   modules, it is also possible to configure the IRQ number as an
   argument to the parport_pc module when it is loaded. For example:
        insmod parport
        insmod parport_pc io=0x378 irq=7

   Note that both the io and irq arguments are required, even if the
   parallel port is using the default I/O base address of 0x378.
   
   The actual interrupt number used by the kernel (7 in the examples
   above) must, of course, match the interrupt line being used by the
   hardware. The IRQ used by the parallel port hardware is usually
   configured in the BIOS setup screen on modern motherboards that have
   built-in parallel ports. Older motherboards or stand-alone ISA cards
   usually have jumpers or DIP switches for configuring the interrupt
   number. The typical assignment of interrupts to parallel ports is as
   follows:
   
   Port Interrupt
   LPT1 7
   LPT2 5
   
   These are reasonable defaults if the actual hardware configuration is
   not known.
   
   As described in Section 5, the pin_init_kernel() function allows
   installation of an interrupt handler function by passing a pointer to
   the handler as the second argument. A NULL value for this parameter
   means that interrupts are disabled. A non-NULL value should be a
   pointer to a callback function that has the following prototype:
   
        void my_interrupt_handler(int irq, void *dev_id, struct pt_regs *regs);

   If and only if a pointer to such a handler function is passed to
   pin_init_kernel, the following functions can then be used to turn
   interrupts on and off:
        pin_enable_irq();
        pin_disable_irq();

   Parapin turns parallel port interrupts off by default. That is, no
   interrupts will be generated until after a call to pin_init_kernel()
   to install the interrupt handler, and a subsequent call to
   pin_enable_irq();
   
   Interrupts must not be enabled and disabled from within the interrupt
   handler itself. In other words, the interrupt handling function passed
   to pin_init_kernel() must not call pin_enable_irq() or
   pin_disable_irq(). However, the handler function does not need to be
   reentrant: the IRQ line that causes an interrupt handler to run is
   automatically disabled by the Linux kernel while the interrupt's
   handler is running. There are other important restrictions on kernel
   programming in general and interrupt-handler writing in particular;
   these issues are beyond the scope of this document. For more details,
   the reader is referred to the Linux kernel programming guides
   mentioned in Section 3.
   
   Some PC hardware generates a spurious parallel port interrupt
   immediately after the parallel port's interrupts are enabled (perhaps
   to help auto-detection of the IRQ number). Parapin includes a
   workaround that prevents this interrupt from being delivered. This is
   done to ensure consistent interrupt behavior across all platforms.
   
                                   Examples
                                       
   Example code using Parapin is included in the Parapin distribution.
   Eventually, this section will have links to it...
   
                          Limitations and Future Work
                                       
   Currently, Parapin only supports a single parallel port at a time. It
   is not possible to have a single instance of the library manage
   multiple instances of a parallel port. This may be a problem for
   software that is simultaneously trying to control multiple parallel
   ports. Someday, I may fix this, but it will make the interface messier
   (a port handle will have to be passed to every function along with pin
   specifiers).
   
   The C-library version of Parapin should probably do better probing of
   the parallel port, but my desire to do this was limited because it
   replicates what is already done by the Linux kernel (and I usually use
   the kernel version of Parapin these days anyway).
