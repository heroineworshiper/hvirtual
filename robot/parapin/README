=== What is Parapin, and where did it come from?

   parapin makes it easy to write C code under Linux that controls
   individual pins on a PC parallel port. This kind of control is very
   useful for electronics projects that use the PC's parallel port as a
   generic digital I/O interface. Parapin goes to great lengths to
   insulate the programmer from the somewhat complex parallel port
   programming interface provided by the PC hardware, making it easy to
   use the parallel port for digital I/O. By the same token, this
   abstraction also makes Parapin less useful in applications that need
   to actually use the parallel port as a parallel port (e.g., for
   talking to a printer).
   
   Parapin has two ``personalities'': it can either be used as a
   user-space C library, or linked as part of a Linux kernel module. The
   user and kernel personalities were both written with efficiency in
   mind, so that Parapin can be used in time-sensitive applications.
   Using Parapin should be very nearly as fast as writing directly to the
   parallel port registers manually.
   
   Parapin provides a simple interface that lets programs use pins of the
   PC parallel port as digital inputs or outputs. Using this interface,
   it is easy to assert high or low TTL logic values on output pins or
   poll the state of input pins. Some pins are bidirectional--that is,
   they can be switched between input and output modes on the fly.

   Parapin was written by Jeremy Elson (jelson@circlemud.org) while at
   the University of Southern California's Information Sciences
   Institute. This work was supported by DARPA under grant No.
   DABT63-99-1-0011 as part of the SCADDS project, and was also made
   possible in part due to support from Cisco Systems. It is freely
   available under the GNU Public License (GPL). Up-to-date information
   about Parapin, including the latest version of the software, can be
   found at the Parapin Home Page:

=== Installing Parapin

   Installing parapin should generally just be a matter of 

	make
	make install

   This will install the library itself (libparapin.a) in /usr/local/lib,
   and the header file (parapin.h) in /usr/local/include.

   The kernel module, kparapin.o, is not installed by default.   


=== Detailed Documentation


   Detailed information about compiling and using parapin can be found
   in the 'doc' directory:

      doc/parapin.ps:    Nicely formatted postscript documentation
      doc/parapin.html:  HTML documentation, not as nicely formatted
      doc/parapin.txt:   Plain ASCII text documentation, looks even worse
      doc/parapin.tex:   LaTeX source of all the above


=== Dire Warning

   Attaching custom electronics to your PC using the parallel port as a
   digital I/O interface can damage both the PC and the electronics if
   you make a mistake. If you're using high voltage electronics, a
   mistake can also cause serious personal injury. Be careful.
   
   If possible, use a parallel port that is on an ISA card, instead of
   one integrated onto the motherboard, to minimize the expense of
   replacing a parallel port controller that you destroy.
   
   USE THIS SOFTWARE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
