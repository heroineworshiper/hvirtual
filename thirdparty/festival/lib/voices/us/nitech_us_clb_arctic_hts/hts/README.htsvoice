*** Installation of HTS Voice ***

(nitech_us_bdl_arctic_hts-2.1.tar.bz2, 
 nitech_us_slt_arctic_hts-2.1.tar.bz2,
 nitech_us_jmk_arctic_hts-2.1.tar.bz2, 
 nitech_us_rms_arctic_hts-2.1.tar.bz2,
 and nitech_us_jmk_arctic_hts-2.1.tar.bz2)

0) Download "nitech_us_awb_arctic_hts-2.1.tar.bz2" from
   http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/ and expand it in the directory
   which you installed the Festival.
 
1) Run Festival

2) To change the current voice, type:

   festival> (voice_nitech_us_awb_arctic_hts)

3) Now you can synthesize speech using the HTS voice in the
   framework of Festival.  See the manual of Festival.

   Example:

     festival > (intro)

     festival > (SayText "Alice was beginning to get tired.")
