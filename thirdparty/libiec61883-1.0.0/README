Overview
--------
This library is an implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers,
and CMP), part 2 (DV-SD), part 4 (MPEG2-TS), and part 6 (AMDTP). Outside of
IIDC, nearly all FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.

The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which transparently
provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also represents
the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for these media types
thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel modules, /dev nodes,
and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug control registers and
connection management that previously existed in experimental form in an
unreleased version of libavc1394.


Requirements
------------
Linux kernel 2.4.20 or newer
libraw1394 1.2.0 or newer


Documentation
-------------
Nearly everything is documented in the header file. The comments from the
header can be extracted and formatted using the Linux kernel script, e.g.:

/usr/src/linux/scripts/kernel-doc -man src/iec61883.h | nroff -man | less


Pkg-Config
----------
The library comes with a pkg-config .pc file, so you can check for
libiec61883 and its version in your configure script. For example, here is how
to use the autoconf macro:

PKG_CHECK_MODULES(LIBIEC61883, libiec61883 >= 1.0.0)

This macro sets the variables LIBIEC61883_CFLAGS and LIBIEC61883_LIBS. You
have to include those into your build variables so that the build process
correctly links with libraw1394.
