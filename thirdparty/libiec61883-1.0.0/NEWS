Version 1.0.0

	First release. This release is mostly feature complete as opposed to
	being an early development release! It is known to be working well on
	little endian platforms for DV and MPEG2-TS applications and is being
	used in early development work on FreeBob for AMDTP. A dvgrab 2.0 is
	flexing DV and being used in a 24/7 multi-host production environment.
	The MPEG2-TS is being used by a few MythTV enthusiasts with digital
	cable and ATSC settop boxes.

	The connection management procedures do a pretty good job of effortless,
	multiple tranmission and reception sessions over a single bus. However,
	it may not support all use case scenarios. Also, CMP seems to be the
	area most poorly or inconsistently implemented by device makers.
	Therefore, it is difficult at this time to support multiple sessions
	in a generic fashion and expect it to Just Work.

	AMDTP is a little crude at the moment. First of all, it does not support
	low latency applications and requirements. Secondly, there are not
	functions to help encode and decode the various audio formats, but there
	is simple label handling for AM824 and label and encoding of IEC 60958
	audio for transmission.
