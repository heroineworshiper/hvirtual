.SH NAME
mkrfc2734 \- Make Linux 2.4 IP over IEEE 1394 capable.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mkrfc2734
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mkrfc2734
adds entries to the Linux IEEE 1394 Configuration ROM to describe itself
to other nodes on the bus as being capable of performing IP over IEEE 1394 
(RFC 2734) duties. This utility is not necessary for Linux 2.6 as there is a kernel
configuration option to enable this. This command takes no arguments and
requires raw1394 kernel module, libraw1394 library, and /dev/raw1394 
device file. Also, it makes absolutely no sense to run this unless you have
also loaded the eth1394 kernel module--the bits that do the real work!
