<h3>6.2 FFTW Constants in Fortran</h3>

<p>When creating plans in FFTW, a number of constants are used to specify
options, such as <code>FFTW_FORWARD</code> or <code>FFTW_ESTIMATE</code>.  The
same constants must be used with the wrapper routines, but of course the
C header files where the constants are defined can't be incorporated
directly into Fortran code.

<p>Instead, we have placed Fortran equivalents of the FFTW constant
definitions in the file <code>fftw3.f</code>, which can be found in the same
directory as <code>fftw3.h</code>.  If your Fortran compiler supports a
preprocessor of some sort, you should be able to <code>include</code> or
<code>#include</code> this file; otherwise, you can paste it directly into
your code.

<p>In C, you combine different flags (like <code>FFTW_PRESERVE_INPUT</code> and
<code>FFTW_MEASURE</code>) using the <code><code>|</code></code> operator; in Fortran you
should just use <code><code>+</code></code>.  (Take care not to add in the same flag
more than once, though.)
