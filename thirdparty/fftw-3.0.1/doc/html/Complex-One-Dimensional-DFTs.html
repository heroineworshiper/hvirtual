<h3>2.1 Complex One-Dimensional DFTs</h3>

<blockquote>
Plan: To bother about the best method of accomplishing an accidental result. 
[Ambrose Bierce, <cite>The Enlarged Devil's Dictionary</cite>.] 
</blockquote>

<p>The basic usage of FFTW to compute a one-dimensional DFT of size
<code>N</code> is simple, and it typically looks something like this code:

<br><pre>#include &lt;fftw3.h&gt;
...
{
    fftw_complex *in, *out;
    fftw_plan p;
    ...
    in = fftw_malloc(sizeof(fftw_complex) * N);
    out = fftw_malloc(sizeof(fftw_complex) * N);
    p = fftw_plan_dft_1d(N, in, out, FFTW_FORWARD, FFTW_ESTIMATE);
    ...
    fftw_execute(p); /* repeat as needed */
    ...
    fftw_destroy_plan(p);
    fftw_free(in); fftw_free(out);
}
</pre>

<p>(When you compile, you must also link with the <code>fftw3</code> library,
e.g. <code>-lfftw3 -lm</code> on Unix systems.)

<p>First you allocate the input and output arrays.  You can allocate them
in any way that you like, but we recommend using <code>fftw_malloc</code>,
which behaves like
<code>malloc</code> except that it properly aligns the array when SIMD
instructions (such as SSE and Altivec) are available (see <a href="SIMD-alignment-and-fftw_malloc.html#SIMD%20alignment%20and%20fftw_malloc">SIMD alignment and fftw_malloc</a>).

<p>The data is an array of type <code>fftw_complex</code>, which is by default a
<code>double[2]</code> composed of the real (<code>in[i][0]</code>) and imaginary
(<code>in[i][1]</code>) parts of a complex number.

<p>The next step is to create a <dfn>plan</dfn>, which is an object
that contains all the data that FFTW needs to compute the FFT. 
This function creates the plan:

<br><pre>fftw_plan fftw_plan_dft_1d(int n, fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out,
                           int sign, unsigned flags);
</pre>

<p>The first argument, <code>n</code>, is the size of the transform you are
trying to compute.  The size <code>n</code> can be any positive integer, but
sizes that are products of small factors are transformed most
efficiently (although prime sizes still use an <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>)
 algorithm).

<p>The next two arguments are pointers to the input and output arrays of
the transform.  These pointers can be equal, indicating an
<dfn>in-place</dfn> transform.

<p>The fourth argument, <code>sign</code>, can be either <code>FFTW_FORWARD</code>
(<code>-1</code>) or <code>FFTW_BACKWARD</code> (<code>+1</code>),
and indicates the direction of the transform you are interested in;
technically, it is the sign of the exponent in the transform.

<p>The <code>flags</code> argument is usually either <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code> or
<code>FFTW_ESTIMATE</code>.  <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code> instructs FFTW to run
and measure the execution time of several FFTs in order to find the
best way to compute the transform of size <code>n</code>.  This process takes
some time (usually a few seconds), depending on your machine and on
the size of the transform.  <code>FFTW_ESTIMATE</code>, on the contrary,
does not run any computation and just builds a
reasonable plan that is probably sub-optimal.  In short, if your
program performs many transforms of the same size and initialization
time is not important, use <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code>; otherwise use the
estimate.  The data in the <code>in</code>/<code>out</code> arrays is
<em>overwritten</em> during <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code> planning, so such
planning should be done <em>before</em> the input is initialized by the
user.

<p>Once the plan has been created, you can use it as many times as you
like for transforms on the specified <code>in</code>/<code>out</code> arrays,
computing the actual transforms via <code>fftw_execute(plan)</code>:
<br><pre>void fftw_execute(const fftw_plan plan);
</pre>

<p>If you want to transform a <em>different</em> array of the same size, you
can create a new plan with <code>fftw_plan_dft_1d</code> and FFTW
automatically reuses the information from the previous plan, if
possible.  (Alternatively, with the "guru" interface you can apply a
given plan to a different array, if you are careful. 
See <a href="FFTW-Reference.html#FFTW%20Reference">FFTW Reference</a>.)

<p>When you are done with the plan, you deallocate it by calling
<code>fftw_destroy_plan(plan)</code>:
<br><pre>void fftw_destroy_plan(fftw_plan plan);
</pre>
Arrays allocated with <code>fftw_malloc</code> should be deallocated by
<code>fftw_free</code> rather than the ordinary <code>free</code> (or, heaven
forbid, <code>delete</code>).

<p>The DFT results are stored in-order in the array <code>out</code>, with the
zero-frequency (DC) component in <code>out[0]</code>. 
If <code>in != out</code>, the transform is <dfn>out-of-place</dfn> and the input
array <code>in</code> is not modified.  Otherwise, the input array is
overwritten with the transform.

<p>Users should note that FFTW computes an <em>unnormalized</em> DFT. 
Thus, computing a forward followed by a backward transform (or vice
versa) results in the original array scaled by <code>n</code>.  For the
definition of the DFT, see <a href="What-FFTW-Really-Computes.html#What%20FFTW%20Really%20Computes">What FFTW Really Computes</a>.

<p>If you have a C compiler, such as <code>gcc</code>, that supports the
recent C99 standard, and you <code>#include &lt;complex.h&gt;</code> <em>before</em>
<code>&lt;fftw3.h&gt;</code>, then <code>fftw_complex</code> is the native
double-precision complex type and you can manipulate it with ordinary
arithmetic.  Otherwise, FFTW defines its own complex type, which is
bit-compatible with the C99 complex type. See <a href="Complex-numbers.html#Complex%20numbers">Complex numbers</a>. 
(The C++ <code>&lt;complex&gt;</code> template class may also be usable via a
typecast.)

<p>Single and long-double precision versions of FFTW may be installed; to
use them, replace the <code>fftw_</code> prefix by <code>fftwf_</code> or
<code>fftwl_</code> and link with <code>-lfftw3f</code> or <code>-lfftw3l</code>, but
use the <em>same</em> <code>&lt;fftw3.h&gt;</code> header file.

<p>Many more flags exist besides <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code> and
<code>FFTW_ESTIMATE</code>.  For example, use <code>FFTW_PATIENT</code> if you're
willing to wait even longer for a possibly even faster plan (see <a href="FFTW-Reference.html#FFTW%20Reference">FFTW Reference</a>). 
You can also save plans for future use, as described by <a href="Words-of-Wisdom-Saving-Plans.html#Words%20of%20Wisdom-Saving%20Plans">Words of Wisdom-Saving Plans</a>.
