<h4>3.2.2 Column-major Format</h4>

<p>Readers from the Fortran world are used to arrays stored in
<dfn>column-major</dfn> order (sometimes called "Fortran order").  This is
essentially the exact opposite of row-major order in that, here, the
<em>first</em> dimension's index varies most quickly.

<p>If you have an array stored in column-major order and wish to
transform it using FFTW, it is quite easy to do.  When creating the
plan, simply pass the dimensions of the array to the planner in
<em>reverse order</em>.  For example, if your array is a rank three
<code>N x M x L</code> matrix in column-major order, you should pass the
dimensions of the array as if it were an <code>L x M x N</code> matrix
(which it is, from the perspective of FFTW).  This is done for you
<em>automatically</em> by the FFTW Fortran interface
(see <a href="Calling-FFTW-from-Fortran.html#Calling%20FFTW%20from%20Fortran">Calling FFTW from Fortran</a>).
