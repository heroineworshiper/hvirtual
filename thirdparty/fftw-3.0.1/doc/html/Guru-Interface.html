<h3>4.5 Guru Interface</h3>

<p>The "guru" interface to FFTW is intended to expose as much as possible
of the flexibility in the underlying FFTW architecture.  It allows one
to compute multi-dimensional "vectors" (loops) of multi-dimensional
transforms, where each vector/transform dimension has an independent
size and stride. 
One can also use more general complex-number formats, e.g. separate real
and imaginary arrays.

<p>In addition to the more flexible planner interface, there are also
guru generalizations of <code>fftw_execute</code> that allow a given plan to
be executed on a different array (sufficiently similar to the
original).  Note that in order to use the guru execute functions, you
do not need to use the guru planner interface: you can create plans
with the basic or advanced interface and execute them with the guru
interface.

<p>For those users who require the flexibility of the guru interface, it is
important that they pay special attention to the documentation lest they
shoot themselves in the foot.
