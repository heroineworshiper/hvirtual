<h4>4.6.4 Wisdom Utilities</h4>

<p>FFTW includes two standalone utility programs that deal with wisdom.  We
merely summarize them here, since they come with their own <code>man</code>
pages for Unix and GNU systems (with HTML versions on our web site).

<p>The first program is <code>fftw-wisdom</code> (or <code>fftwf-wisdom</code> in
single precision, etcetera), which can be used to create a wisdom file
containing plans for any of the transform sizes and types supported by
FFTW.  It is preferable to create wisdom directly from your executable
(see <a href="Caveats-in-Using-Wisdom.html#Caveats%20in%20Using%20Wisdom">Caveats in Using Wisdom</a>), but this program is useful for
creating global wisdom files for <code>fftw_import_system_wisdom</code>.

<p>The second program is <code>fftw-wisdom-to-conf</code>, which takes a wisdom
file as input and produces a <dfn>configuration routine</dfn> as output.  The
latter is a C subroutine that you can compile and link into your
program, replacing a routine of the same name in the FFTW library, that
determines which parts of FFTW are callable by your program. 
<code>fftw-wisdom-to-conf</code> produces a configuration routine that links
to only those parts of FFTW needed by the saved plans in the wisdom,
greatly reducing the size of statically linked executables (which should
only attempt to create plans corresponding to those in the wisdom,
however).
