<h4>3.1.2 Stack alignment on x86</h4>

<p>On the Pentium and subsequent x86 processors, there is a substantial
performance penalty if double-precision variables are not stored
8-byte aligned; a factor of two or more is not unusual. 
Unfortunately, the stack (the place that local variables and
subroutine arguments live) is not guaranteed by the Intel ABI to be
8-byte aligned.

<p>Recent versions of <code>gcc</code> (as well as most other compilers, we are
told, such as Intel's, Metrowerks', and Microsoft's) are able to keep
the stack 8-byte aligned; <code>gcc</code> does this by default (see
<code>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</code> in the <code>gcc</code> documentation). 
If you are not certain whether your compiler maintains stack alignment
by default, it is a good idea to make sure.

<p>Unfortunately, <code>gcc</code> only <em>preserves</em> the stack
alignment--as a result, if the stack starts off misaligned, it will
always be misaligned, with a disastrous effect on performance (in
double precision).  Fortunately, recent versions of glibc (on
GNU/Linux) provide a properly-aligned starting stack, but this was not
the case with a number of older versions, and we are not certain of
the situation on other operating systems.  Hopefully, as time goes by
this will become less of a concern, but if you want to be paranoid you
can copy the code from FFTW's <code>libbench2/aligned-main.c</code> to
guarantee alignment of your <code>main</code> function (with <code>gcc</code>).
