<h4>4.3.2 Planner Flags</h4>

<p>All of the planner routines in FFTW accept an integer <code>flags</code>
argument, which is a bitwise OR (<code>|</code>) of zero or more of the flag
constants defined below.  These flags control the rigor (and time) of
the planning process, and can also impose (or lift) restrictions on the
type of transform algorithm that is employed.

<h5>Planning-rigor flags</h5>

<ul>

<li><code>FFTW_ESTIMATE</code> specifies that, instead of actual measurements of
different algorithms, a simple heuristic is used to pick a (probably
sub-optimal) plan quickly.  With this flag, the input/output arrays are
not overwritten during planning.

<li><code>FFTW_MEASURE</code> tells FFTW to find an optimized plan by actually
<em>computing</em> several FFTs and measuring their execution time. 
Depending on your machine, this can take some time (often a few
seconds).  <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code> is the default planning option.

<li><code>FFTW_PATIENT</code> is like <code>FFTW_MEASURE</code>, but considers a wider
range of algorithms and often produces a "more optimal" plan
(especially for large transforms), but at the expense of several times
longer planning time (especially for large transforms).

<li><code>FFTW_EXHAUSTIVE</code> is like <code>FFTW_PATIENT</code>, but considers an
even wider range of algorithms, including many that we think are
unlikely to be fast, to produce the most optimal plan but with a
substantially increased planning time.

</ul>

<h5>Algorithm-restriction flags</h5>

<ul>

<li><code>FFTW_DESTROY_INPUT</code> specifies that an out-of-place transform is
allowed to <em>overwrite its input</em> array with arbitrary data; this
can sometimes allow more efficient algorithms to be employed.

<li><code>FFTW_PRESERVE_INPUT</code> specifies that an out-of-place transform must
<em>not change its input</em> array.  This is ordinarily the
<em>default</em>, except for c2r and hc2r (i.e. complex-to-real)
transforms for which <code>FFTW_DESTROY_INPUT</code> is the default.  In the
latter cases, passing <code>FFTW_PRESERVE_INPUT</code> will attempt to use
algorithms that do not destroy the input, at the expense of worse
performance; for multi-dimensional c2r transforms, however, no
input-preserving algorithms are implemented and the planner will return
<code>NULL</code> if one is requested.

<li><code>FFTW_UNALIGNED</code> specifies that the algorithm may not
impose any unusual alignment requirements on the input/output arrays
(i.e. no SIMD may be used).  This flag is normally <em>not necessary</em>,
since the planner automatically detects misaligned arrays.  The only use
for this flag is if you want to use the guru interface to execute a
given plan on a different array that may not be aligned like the
original.  (Using <code>fftw_malloc</code> makes this flag unnecessary even
then.)

</ul>
