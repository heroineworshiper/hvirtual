<h4>4.5.6 Guru Execution of Plans</h4>

<p>Normally, one executes a plan for the arrays with which the plan was
created, by calling <code>fftw_execute(plan)</code> as described in <a href="Using-Plans.html#Using%20Plans">Using Plans</a>. 
However, it is possible to apply a given plan to a <em>different</em>
array using the guru functions detailed below, provided that the
following conditions are met:

<ul>

<li>The array size, strides, etcetera are the same (since those are set by
the plan).

<li>The input and output arrays are the same (in-place) or different
(out-of-place) if the plan was originally created to be in-place or
out-of-place, respectively.

<li>For split arrays, the separations between the real and imaginary
parts, <code>ii-ri</code> and <code>io-ro</code>, are the same as they were for
the input and output arrays when the plan was created.  (This
condition is automatically satisfied for interleaved arrays.)

<li>The <dfn>alignment</dfn> of the new input/output arrays is the same as that
of the input/output arrays when the plan was created, unless the plan
was created with the <code>FFTW_UNALIGNED</code> flag. 
Here, the alignment is a platform-dependent quantity (for example, it is
the address modulo 16 if SSE SIMD instructions are used, but the address
modulo 4 for non-SIMD single-precision FFTW on the same machine).  In
general, only arrays allocated with <code>fftw_malloc</code> are guaranteed to
be equally aligned.

</ul>

<p>If you are tempted to use this guru interface because you want to
transform a known bunch of arrays of the same size, <strong>stop here</strong>
and go use the advanced interface instead (see <a href="Advanced-Interface.html#Advanced%20Interface">Advanced Interface</a>)).

<p>The guru execute functions are:

<br><pre>void fftw_execute_dft(
     const fftw_plan p,
     fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out);

void fftw_execute_split_dft(
     const fftw_plan p,
     double *ri, double *ii, double *ro, double *io);

void fftw_execute_dft_r2c(
     const fftw_plan p,
     double *in, fftw_complex *out);

void fftw_execute_split_dft_r2c(
     const fftw_plan p,
     double *in, double *ro, double *io);

void fftw_execute_dft_c2r(
     const fftw_plan p,
     fftw_complex *in, double *out);

void fftw_execute_split_dft_c2r(
     const fftw_plan p,
     double *ri, double *ii, double *out);

void fftw_execute_r2r(
     const fftw_plan p,
     double *in, double *out);
</pre>

<p>These execute the <code>plan</code> to compute the corresponding transform on
the input/output arrays specified by the subsequent arguments.  The
input/output array arguments have the same meanings as the ones passed
to the guru planner routines in the preceding sections.  The <code>plan</code>
is not modified, and these routines can be called as many times as
desired, or intermixed with calls to the ordinary <code>fftw_execute</code>.

<p>The <code>plan</code> <em>must</em> have been created for the transform type
corresponding to the execute function, e.g. it must be a complex-DFT
plan for <code>fftw_execute_dft</code>.  Any of the planner routines for that
transform type, from the basic to the guru interface, could have been
used to create the plan, however.
