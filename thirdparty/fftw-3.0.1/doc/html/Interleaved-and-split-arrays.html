<h4>4.5.1 Interleaved and split arrays</h4>

<p>The guru interface supports two representations of complex numbers,
which we call the interleaved and the split format.

<p>The <dfn>interleaved</dfn> format is the same one used by the basic and
advanced interfaces, and it is documented in <a href="Complex-numbers.html#Complex%20numbers">Complex numbers</a>. 
In the interleaved format, you provide pointers to the real part of a
complex number, and the imaginary part understood to be stored in the
next memory location.

<p>The <dfn>split</dfn> format allows separate pointers to the real and
imaginary parts of a complex array.

<p>Technically, the interleaved format is redundant, because you can
always express an interleaved array in terms of a split array with
appropriate pointers and strides.  On the other hand, the interleaved
format is simpler to use, and it is common in practice.  Hence, FFTW
supports it as a special case.
