<h3>8.2 Installation on non-Unix systems</h3>

<p>It should be relatively straightforward to compile FFTW even on non-Unix
systems lacking the niceties of a <code>configure</code> script.  Basically,
you need to edit the <code>config.h</code> header (copy it from
<code>config.h.in</code>) to <code>#define</code> the various options and compiler
characteristics, and then compile all the <code>.c</code> files in the
relevant directories.

<p>The <code>config.h</code> header contains about 100 options to set, each one
initially an <code>#undef</code>, all documented with a comment, and most of
them fairly obvious.  For most of the options, you should simply
<code>#define</code> them to <code>1</code> if they are applicable, although a few
options require a particular value (e.g. <code>SIZEOF_LONG_LONG</code> should
be defined to the size of the <code>long long</code> type, in bytes, or zero
if it is not supported).  We will likely post some sample
<code>config.h</code> files for various operating systems and compilers for
you to use (at least as a starting point).  Please let us know if you
have to hand-create a configuration file (and/or a pre-compiled binary)
that you want to share.

<p>To create the FFTW library, you will then need to compile all of the
<code>.c</code> files in the <code>kernel</code>, <code>dft</code>, <code>dft/codelets</code>,
<code>dft/codelets/standard</code>, <code>dft/codelets/inplace</code>, <code>rdft</code>,
<code>rdft/codelets</code>, <code>rdft/codelets/r2hc</code>,
<code>rdft/codelets/hc2r</code>, <code>rdft/codelets/r2r</code>, <code>reodft</code>, and
<code>api</code> directories.  If you are compiling with SIMD support
(e.g. you defined <code>HAVE_SSE2</code> in <code>config.h</code>), then you also
need to compile the <code>.c</code> files in the <code>simd</code>, <code>dft/simd</code>,
and <code>dft/simd/codelets</code> directories.  If you are compiling with AMD
K7 optimizations (i.e. you defined <code>HAVE_K7</code>), then you also need
to include the <code>dft/k7</code> and <code>dft/k7/codelets</code> directories. 
(See the previous section for more information on configuration options
like SIMD and K7 optimization; each Unix configuration option has a
corresponding <code>#define</code> in <code>config.h</code>.)

<p>Once these files are all compiled, link them into a library, or a shared
library, or directly into your program.

<p>To compile the FFTW test program, additionally compile the code in the
<code>libbench2/</code> directory, and link it into a library.  Then compile
the code in the <code>tests/</code> directory and link it to the
<code>libbench2</code> and FFTW libraries.  To compile the <code>fftw-wisdom</code>
(command-line) tool (see <a href="Wisdom-Utilities.html#Wisdom%20Utilities">Wisdom Utilities</a>), compile
<code>tools/fftw-wisdom.c</code> and link it to the <code>libbench2</code> and FFTW
libraries
