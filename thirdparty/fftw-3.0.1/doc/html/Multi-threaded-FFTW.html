<h3>5.1 Multi-threaded FFTW</h3>

<p>In this section we document the parallel FFTW routines for shared-memory
threads on SMP hardware.  These routines, which support parallel one-
and multi-dimensional transforms of both real and complex data, are the
easiest way to take advantage of multiple processors with FFTW.  They
work just like the corresponding uniprocessor transform routines, except
that you have an extra initialization routine to call, and there is a
routine to set the number of threads to employ.  Any program that uses
the uniprocessor FFTW can therefore be trivially modified to use the
multi-threaded FFTW.
