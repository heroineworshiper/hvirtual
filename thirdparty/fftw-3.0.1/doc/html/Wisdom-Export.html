<h4>4.6.1 Wisdom Export</h4>

<br><pre>void fftw_export_wisdom_to_file(FILE *output_file);
char *fftw_export_wisdom_to_string(void);
void fftw_export_wisdom(void (*write_char)(char c, void *), void *data);
</pre>

<p>These functions allow you to export all currently accumulated wisdom
in a form from which it can be later imported and restored, even
during a separate run of the program. (See <a href="Words-of-Wisdom-Saving-Plans.html#Words%20of%20Wisdom-Saving%20Plans">Words of Wisdom-Saving Plans</a>.)  The current store of wisdom is not affected by calling any
of these routines.

<p><code>fftw_export_wisdom</code> exports the wisdom to any output
medium, as specified by the callback function
<code>write_char</code>. <code>write_char</code> is a <code>putc</code>-like function that
writes the character <code>c</code> to some output; its second parameter is
the <code>data</code> pointer passed to <code>fftw_export_wisdom</code>.  For
convenience, the following two "wrapper" routines are provided:

<p><code>fftw_export_wisdom_to_file</code> writes the wisdom to the
current position in <code>output_file</code>, which should be open with write
permission.  Upon exit, the file remains open and is positioned at the
end of the wisdom data.

<p><code>fftw_export_wisdom_to_string</code> returns a pointer to a
<code>NULL</code>-terminated string holding the wisdom data. This string is
dynamically allocated, and it is the responsibility of the caller to
deallocate it with <code>fftw_free</code> when it is no longer needed.

<p>All of these routines export the wisdom in the same format, which we
will not document here except to say that it is LISP-like ASCII text
that is insensitive to white space.
