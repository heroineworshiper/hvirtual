<h4>2.5.2 Real even/odd DFTs (cosine/sine transforms)</h4>

<p>The Fourier transform of a real-even function f(-x) = f(x) is
real-even, and i times the Fourier transform of a real-odd
function f(-x) = -f(x) is real-odd.  Similar results hold for a
discrete Fourier transform, and thus for these symmetries the need for
complex inputs/outputs is entirely eliminated.  Moreover, one gains a
factor of two in speed/space from the fact that the data are real, and
an additional factor of two from the even/odd symmetry: only the
non-redundant (first) half of the array need be stored.  The result is
the real-even DFT (<dfn>REDFT</dfn>) and the real-odd DFT (<dfn>RODFT</dfn>), also
known as the discrete cosine and sine transforms (<dfn>DCT</dfn> and
<dfn>DST</dfn>), respectively.

<p>(In this section, we describe the 1d transforms; multi-dimensional
transforms are just a separable product of these transforms operating
along each dimension.)

<p>Because of the discrete sampling, one has an additional choice: is the
data even/odd around a sampling point, or around the point halfway
between two samples?  The latter corresponds to <em>shifting</em> the
samples by <em>half</em> an interval, and gives rise to several transform
variants denoted by REDFTab and RODFTab: a and
b are 0 or 1, and indicate whether the input
(a) and/or output (b) are shifted by half a sample
(1 means it is shifted).  These are also known as types I-IV of
the DCT and DST, and all four types are supported by FFTW's r2r
interface.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<p>The r2r kinds for the various REDFT and RODFT types supported by FFTW,
along with the boundary conditions at both ends of the <em>input</em>
array (<code>n</code> real numbers <code>in[j=0..n-1]</code>), are:

<ul>

<li><code>FFTW_REDFT00</code> (DCT-I): even around j=0 and even around j=n-1.

<li><code>FFTW_REDFT10</code> (DCT-II): even around j=-0.5 and even around j=n-0.5.

<li><code>FFTW_REDFT01</code> (DCT-III): even around j=0 and odd around j=n.

<li><code>FFTW_REDFT11</code> (DCT-IV): even around j=-0.5 and odd around j=n-0.5.

<li><code>FFTW_RODFT00</code> (DST-I): odd around j=-1 and odd around j=n.

<li><code>FFTW_RODFT10</code> (DST-II): odd around j=-0.5 and odd around j=n-0.5.

<li><code>FFTW_RODFT01</code> (DST-III): odd around j=-1 and even around j=n-1.

<li><code>FFTW_RODFT11</code> (DST-IV): odd around j=-0.5 and even around j=n-0.5.

</ul>

<p>Note that these symmetries apply to the "logical" array being
transformed; <strong>there are no constraints on your physical input
data</strong>.  So, for example, if you specify a size-5 REDFT00 (DCT-I) of the
data abcde, it corresponds to the DFT of the logical even array
abcdedcb of size 8.  A size-4 REDFT10 (DCT-II) of the data
abcd corresponds to the size-8 logical DFT of the even array
abcddcba, shifted by half a sample.

<p>All of these transforms are invertible.  The inverse of R*DFT00 is
R*DFT00; of R*DFT10 is R*DFT01 and vice versa; and of R*DFT11 is
R*DFT11.  However, the transforms computed by FFTW are unnormalized,
exactly like the corresponding real and complex DFTs, so computing a
transform followed by its inverse yields the original array scaled by
N, where N is the <em>logical</em> DFT size.  For REDFT00,
N=2(n-1); for RODFT00, N=2(n+1); otherwise, N=2n.

<p>Note that the boundary conditions of the transform output array are
given by the input boundary conditions of the inverse transform. 
Thus, the above transforms are all inequivalent in terms of
input/output boundary conditions, even neglecting the 0.5 shift
difference.

<p>FFTW is most efficient when N is a product of small factors; note
that this <em>differs</em> from the factorization of the physical size
<code>n</code> for REDFT00 and RODFT00!  There is another oddity: <code>n=1</code>
REDFT00 transforms correspond to N=0, and so are <em>not
defined</em> (the planner will return <code>NULL</code>).  Otherwise, any positive
<code>n</code> is supported.

<p>For the precise mathematical definitions of these transforms as used by
FFTW, see <a href="What-FFTW-Really-Computes.html#What%20FFTW%20Really%20Computes">What FFTW Really Computes</a>.  (For people accustomed to the
DCT/DST, FFTW's definitions have a coefficient of 2 in front of
the cos/sin functions so that they correspond precisely to an even/odd
DFT of size N.)

<h5>Which type do you need?</h5>

<p>Since the required flavor of even/odd DFT depends upon your problem, you
are the best judge of this choice, but we can make a few comments on
relative efficiency to help you in your selection.  In particular,
R*DFT01 and R*DFT10 tend to be slightly faster than R*DFT11 (especially
for odd sizes), while the R*DFT00 transforms are significantly
slower.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<p>Thus, if only the boundary conditions on the transform inputs are
specified, we generally recommend R*DFT10 over R*DFT00 and R*DFT01 over
R*DFT11 (unless the half-sample shift or the self-inverse property is
significant for your problem).

<p>If performance is important to you and you are using only small sizes
(say n&lt;200), e.g. for multi-dimensional transforms, then you
might consider generating hard-coded transforms of those sizes and types
that you are interested in (see <a href="Generating-your-own-code.html#Generating%20your%20own%20code">Generating your own code</a>).

<p>We are interested in hearing what types of symmetric transforms you find
most useful.

<hr><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>There are also type V-VIII transforms, which
correspond to a logical DFT of <em>odd</em> size N, independent of
whether the physical size <code>n</code> is odd, but we do not support these
variants.</p>

<li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>R*DFT00 is slower in FFTW because we discovered that
the standard algorithm for computing this by a pre/post-processed real
DFT---the algorithm used in FFTPACK, Numerical Recipes, and other
sources for decades now---has serious numerical problems: it already
loses several decimal places of accuracy for 16k sizes.  There seem to
be only two alternatives in the literature that do not suffer similarly:
a recursive decomposition into smaller DCTs, which would require a large
set of codelets for efficiency and generality, or sacrificing a factor
of two in speed to use a real DFT of twice the size.  We currently
employ the latter technique.</p>
