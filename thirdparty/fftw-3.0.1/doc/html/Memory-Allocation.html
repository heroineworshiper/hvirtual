<h4>4.1.3 Memory Allocation</h4>

<br><pre>void *fftw_malloc(size_t n);
void fftw_free(void *p);
</pre>

<p>These are functions that behave identically to <code>malloc</code> and
<code>free</code>, except that they guarantee that the returned pointer obeys
any special alignment restrictions imposed by any algorithm in FFTW
(e.g. for SIMD acceleration).  See <a href="Data-Alignment.html#Data%20Alignment">Data Alignment</a>.

<p>Data allocated by <code>fftw_malloc</code> <em>must</em> be deallocated by
<code>fftw_free</code> and not by the ordinary <code>free</code>.

<p>These routines simply call through to your operating system's
<code>malloc</code> or, if necessary, its aligned equivalent
(e.g. <code>memalign</code>), so you normally need not worry about any
significant time or space overhead.  You are <em>not required</em> to use
them to allocate your data, but we strongly recommend it.
