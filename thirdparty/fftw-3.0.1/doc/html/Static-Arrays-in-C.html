<h4>3.2.3 Static Arrays in C</h4>

<p>Multi-dimensional arrays declared statically (that is, at compile time,
not necessarily with the <code>static</code> keyword) in C are <em>already</em>
in row-major order.  You don't have to do anything special to transform
them.  For example:

<br><pre>{
     fftw_complex data[NX][NY][NZ];
     fftw_plan plan;
     ...
     plan = fftw_plan_dft_3d(NX, NY, NZ, &amp;data[0][0][0], &amp;data[0][0][0],
                             FFTW_FORWARD, FFTW_ESTIMATE);
     ...
}
</pre>

<p>This will plan a 3d in-place transform of size <code>NX x NY x NZ</code>. 
Notice how we took the address of the zero-th element to pass to the
planner (we could also have used a typecast).

<p>However, we tend to <em>discourage</em> users from declaring their
arrays statically in this way, for two reasons.  First, this allocates
the array on the stack, which has a very limited size on most
operating systems (declaring an array with more than a few thousand
elements will often cause a crash).  Second, it may not optimally
align the array if you link with a SIMD FFTW (see <a href="SIMD-alignment-and-fftw_malloc.html#SIMD%20alignment%20and%20fftw_malloc">SIMD alignment and fftw_malloc</a>).  Instead, we recommend using <code>fftw_malloc</code>, as
described below.
