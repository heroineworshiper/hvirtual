<h4>3.2.4 Dynamic Arrays in C</h4>

<p>We recommend allocating most arrays dynamically, with
<code>fftw_malloc</code>.  This isn't too hard to do, although it is not as
straightforward for multi-dimensional arrays as it is for
one-dimensional arrays.

<p>Creating the array is simple: using a dynamic-allocation routine like
<code>fftw_malloc</code>, allocate an array big enough to store N
<code>fftw_complex</code> values (for a complex DFT), where N is the product
of the sizes of the array dimensions (i.e. the total number of complex
values in the array).  For example, here is code to allocate a 5x12x27
rank 3 array:

<br><pre>fftw_complex *an_array;
an_array = fftw_malloc(5*12*27 * sizeof(fftw_complex));
</pre>

<p>Accessing the array elements, however, is more tricky--you can't simply
use multiple applications of the <code>[]</code> operator like you could for
static arrays.  Instead, you have to explicitly compute the offset into
the array using the formula given earlier for row-major arrays.  For
example, to reference the (i,j,k)-th element of the array
allocated above, you would use the expression <code>an_array[k + 27 * (j
+ 12 * i)]</code>.

<p>This pain can be alleviated somewhat by defining appropriate macros,
or, in C++, creating a class and overloading the <code>()</code> operator. 
The recent C99 standard provides a way to dynamically reinterpret the
array as a static-like multi-dimensional array amenable to <code>[]</code>,
but this feature is not yet widely supported by compilers.
