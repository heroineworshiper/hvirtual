<p>This chapter describes the basic usage of FFTW, i.e., how to compute
the Fourier transform of a single array.  This chapter tells the
truth, but not the <em>whole</em> truth. Specifically, FFTW implements
additional routines and flags that are not documented here, although
in many cases we try to indicate where added capabilities exist.  For
more complete information, see <a href="FFTW-Reference.html#FFTW%20Reference">FFTW Reference</a>.  (Note that you
need to compile and install FFTW before you can use it in a program. 
For the details of the installation, see <a href="Installation-and-Customization.html#Installation%20and%20Customization">Installation and Customization</a>.)

<p>We recommend that you read this tutorial in order.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  At the least, read the first section (see <a href="Complex-One-Dimensional-DFTs.html#Complex%20One-Dimensional%20DFTs">Complex One-Dimensional DFTs</a>) before reading any of the others, even if your
main interest lies in one of the other transform types.

<p>Users of FFTW version 2 and earlier may also want to read <a href="Upgrading-from-FFTW-version-2.html#Upgrading%20from%20FFTW%20version%202">Upgrading from FFTW version 2</a>.

<p>You can
read the tutorial in bit-reversed order after computing your first
transform.</p>
