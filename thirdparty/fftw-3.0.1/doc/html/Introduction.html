<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This manual documents version 3.0.1 of FFTW, the
<em>Fastest Fourier Transform in the West</em>.  FFTW is a comprehensive
collection of fast C routines for computing the discrete Fourier
transform (DFT) and various special cases thereof.
<ul>
<li>FFTW computes the DFT of complex data, real data, even-
  or odd-symmetric real data (these symmetric transforms are usually
  known as the discrete cosine or sine transform, respectively), and the
  discrete Hartley transform (DHT) of real data.

<li>The input data can have arbitrary size. 
       FFTW employs <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>&nbsp;log&nbsp;<i>n</i>)
 algorithms for all sizes, including
       prime numbers.

<li>FFTW supports arbitrary n-dimensional data.

<li>FFTW supports the SSE, SSE2, 3DNow!, and Altivec instruction
       sets.

<li>FFTW 3.0.1 includes parallel (multi-threaded) transforms
  for shared-memory systems. 
  FFTW 3.0.1 does not include distributed-memory parallel
  transforms, but we plan to implement an MPI version soon.  (Meanwhile,
  you can use the MPI implementation from FFTW 2.1.3.) 
</ul>

<p>We assume herein that you are familiar with the properties and uses of
the DFT that are relevant to your application.  Otherwise, see
e.g. <cite>The Fast Fourier Transform and Its Applications</cite> by E. O. Brigham
(Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 1988). 
<a href="http://www.fftw.org">Our web page</a> also has links to FFT-related
information online.

<p>In order to use FFTW effectively, you need to learn one basic concept
of FFTW's internal structure: FFTW does not use a fixed algorithm for
computing the transform, but instead it adapts the DFT algorithm to
details of the underlying hardware in order to maximize performance. 
Hence, the computation of the transform is split into two phases. 
First, FFTW's <dfn>planner</dfn> "learns" the fastest way to compute the
transform on your machine.  The planner
produces a data structure called a <dfn>plan</dfn> that contains this
information.  Subsequently, the plan is <dfn>executed</dfn>
to transform the array of input data as dictated by the plan.  The
plan can be reused as many times as needed.  In typical
high-performance applications, many transforms of the same size are
computed and, consequently, a relatively expensive initialization of
this sort is acceptable.  On the other hand, if you need a single
transform of a given size, the one-time cost of the planner becomes
significant.  For this case, FFTW provides fast planners based on
heuristics or on previously computed plans.

<p>FFTW supports transforms of data with arbitrary size, rank,
multiplicity, and a general memory layout.  In simple cases, however,
this generality may be unnecessary and confusing.  Consequently, we
organized the interface to FFTW into three levels of increasing
generality.
<ul>
<li>The <dfn>basic interface</dfn> computes a single
      transform of contiguous data. 
<li>The <dfn>advanced interface</dfn> computes transforms
      of multiple or strided arrays. 
<li>The <dfn>guru</dfn> interface supports the most general data
      layouts, multiplicities, and strides. 
</ul>
We expect that most users will be best served by the basic interface,
whereas the guru interface requires careful attention to the
documentation to avoid problems.

<p>Besides the automatic performance adaptation performed by the planner,
it is also possible for advanced users to customize FFTW manually.  For
example, if code space is a concern, we provide a tool that links only
the subset of FFTW needed by your application.  Conversely, you may need
to extend FFTW because the standard distribution is not sufficient for
your needs.  For example, the standard FFTW distribution works most
efficiently for arrays whose size can be factored into small primes
(2, 3, 5, and 7), and otherwise it uses a
slower general-purpose routine.  If you need efficient transforms of
other sizes, you can use FFTW's code generator, which produces fast C
programs ("codelets") for any particular array size you may care
about. 
For example, if you need transforms of size
513&nbsp;=&nbsp;19*3<sup>3</sup>,
you can customize FFTW to support the factor 19 efficiently.

<p>For more information regarding FFTW, see the paper, "FFTW: An
adaptive software architecture for the FFT," by M. Frigo and
S. G. Johnson, which appeared in the 23rd International Conference on
Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (<cite>Proc. ICASSP 1998</cite>
<b>3</b>, p. 1381).  See also, "The Fastest Fourier Transform in the
West," by M. Frigo and S. G. Johnson, which is the technical report
MIT-LCS-TR-728 (Sep. '97).  The code generator is described in the
paper "A fast Fourier transform compiler",
by M. Frigo, in the <cite>Proceedings of the 1999 ACM SIGPLAN Conference
on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), Atlanta,
Georgia, May 1999</cite>.  These papers, along with the latest version of
FFTW, the FAQ, benchmarks, and other links, are available at
<a href="http://www.fftw.org">the FFTW home page</a>.

<p>The current version of FFTW incorporates many good ideas from the past
thirty years of FFT literature.  In one way or another, FFTW uses the
Cooley-Tukey algorithm, the prime factor algorithm, Rader's algorithm
for prime sizes, and a split-radix algorithm (with a variation due to
Dan Bernstein).  FFTW's code generator also produces new algorithms
that we do not completely understand. 
The reader is referred to the cited papers for the appropriate
references.

<p>The rest of this manual is organized as follows.  We first discuss the
sequential (single-processor) implementation.  We start by describing
the basic interface/features of FFTW in <a href="Tutorial.html#Tutorial">Tutorial</a>.  The following
chapter discusses <a href="Other-Important-Topics.html#Other%20Important%20Topics">Other Important Topics</a>, including <a href="Data-Alignment.html#Data%20Alignment">Data Alignment</a>, the storage scheme of multi-dimensional arrays
(see <a href="Multi-dimensional-Array-Format.html#Multi-dimensional%20Array%20Format">Multi-dimensional Array Format</a>), and FFTW's mechanism for
storing plans on disk (see <a href="Words-of-Wisdom-Saving-Plans.html#Words%20of%20Wisdom-Saving%20Plans">Words of Wisdom-Saving Plans</a>).  Next,
<a href="FFTW-Reference.html#FFTW%20Reference">FFTW Reference</a> provides comprehensive documentation of all
FFTW's features.  Parallel transforms are discussed in their own
chapter <a href="Parallel-FFTW.html#Parallel%20FFTW">Parallel FFTW</a>.  Fortran programmers can also use FFTW,
as described in <a href="Calling-FFTW-from-Fortran.html#Calling%20FFTW%20from%20Fortran">Calling FFTW from Fortran</a>.  <a href="Installation-and-Customization.html#Installation%20and%20Customization">Installation and Customization</a> explains how to install FFTW in your computer
system and how to adapt FFTW to your needs.  License and copyright
