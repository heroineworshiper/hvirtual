<h3>6.3 Fortran Examples</h3>

<p>In C, you might have something like the following to transform a
one-dimensional complex array:

<br><pre>        fftw_complex in[N], out[N];
        fftw_plan plan;

        plan = fftw_plan_dft_1d(N,in,out,FFTW_FORWARD,FFTW_ESTIMATE);
        fftw_execute(plan);
        fftw_destroy_plan(plan);
</pre>

<p>In Fortran, you would use the following to accomplish the same thing:

<br><pre>        double complex in, out
        dimension in(N), out(N)
        integer*8 plan

        call dfftw_plan_dft_1d(plan,N,in,out,FFTW_FORWARD,FFTW_ESTIMATE)
        call dfftw_execute(plan)
        call dfftw_destroy_plan(plan)
</pre>

<p>Notice how all routines are called as Fortran subroutines, and the plan
is returned via the first argument to <code>dfftw_plan_dft_1d</code>.  To do
the same thing, but using 8 threads in parallel (see <a href="Multi-threaded-FFTW.html#Multi-threaded%20FFTW">Multi-threaded FFTW</a>), you would simply prefix these calls with:

<br><pre>        call dfftw_init_threads
        call dfftw_plan_with_nthreads(8)
</pre>

<p>To transform a three-dimensional array in-place with C, you might do:

<br><pre>        fftw_complex arr[L][M][N];
        fftw_plan plan;

        plan = fftw_plan_dft_3d(L,M,N, arr,arr,
                                FFTW_FORWARD, FFTW_ESTIMATE);
        fftw_execute(plan);
        fftw_destroy_plan(plan);
</pre>

<p>In Fortran, you would use this instead:

<br><pre>        double complex arr
        dimension arr(L,M,N)
        integer*8 plan

        call dfftw_plan_dft_3d(plan, L,M,N, arr,arr,
       &amp;                       FFTW_FORWARD, FFTW_ESTIMATE)
        call dfftw_execute(plan)
        call dfftw_destroy_plan(plan)
</pre>

<p>Note that we pass the array dimensions in the "natural" order in both C
and Fortran.

<p>To transform a one-dimensional real array in Fortran, you might do:

<br><pre>        double precision in
        dimension in(N)
        double complex out
        dimension out(N/2 + 1)
        integer*8 plan

        call dfftw_plan_dft_r2c_1d(plan,N,in,out,FFTW_ESTIMATE)
        call dfftw_execute(plan)
        call dfftw_destroy_plan(plan)
</pre>

<p>To transform a two-dimensional real array, out of place, you might use
the following:

<br><pre>        double precision in
        dimension in(M,N)
        double complex out
        dimension out(M/2 + 1, N)
        integer*8 plan

        call dfftw_plan_dft_r2c_2d(plan,M,N,in,out,FFTW_ESTIMATE)
        call dfftw_execute(plan)
        call dfftw_destroy_plan(plan)
</pre>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Notice that it is the <em>first</em> dimension of the
complex output array that is cut in half in Fortran, rather than the
last dimension as in C.  This is a consequence of the interface routines
reversing the order of the array dimensions passed to FFTW so that the
Fortran program can use its ordinary column-major order.
