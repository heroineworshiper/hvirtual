<h3>2.2 Complex Multi-Dimensional DFTs</h3>

<p>Multi-dimensional transforms work much the same way as one-dimensional
transforms: you allocate arrays of <code>fftw_complex</code> (preferably
using <code>fftw_malloc</code>), create an <code>fftw_plan</code>, execute it as
many times as you want with <code>fftw_execute(plan)</code>, and clean up
with <code>fftw_destroy_plan(plan)</code> (and <code>fftw_free</code>).  The only
difference is the routine you use to create the plan:

<br><pre>fftw_plan fftw_plan_dft_2d(int nx, int ny,
                           fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out,
                           int sign, unsigned flags);
fftw_plan fftw_plan_dft_3d(int nx, int ny, int nz,
                           fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out,
                           int sign, unsigned flags);
fftw_plan fftw_plan_dft(int rank, const int *n,
                        fftw_complex *in, fftw_complex *out,
                        int sign, unsigned flags);
</pre>

<p>These routines create plans for <code>nx</code> by <code>ny</code> two-dimensional
(2d) transforms, <code>nx</code> by <code>ny</code> by <code>nz</code> 3d transforms,
and arbitrary <code>rank</code>-dimensional transforms, respectively.  In the
third case, <code>n</code> is a pointer to an array <code>n[rank]</code> denoting
an <code>n[0]</code> by <code>n[1]</code> by <small>...</small> by <code>n[rank-1]</code>
transform.  All of these transforms operate on contiguous arrays in
the C-standard <dfn>row-major</dfn> order, so that the last dimension has
the fastest-varying index in the array.  This layout is described
further in <a href="Multi-dimensional-Array-Format.html#Multi-dimensional%20Array%20Format">Multi-dimensional Array Format</a>.

<p>You may have noticed that all the planner routines described so far
have overlapping functionality.  For example, you can plan a 1d or 2d
transform by using <code>fftw_plan_dft</code> with a <code>rank</code> of <code>1</code>
or <code>2</code>, or even by calling <code>fftw_plan_dft_3d</code> with <code>nx</code>
and/or <code>ny</code> equal to <code>1</code> (with no loss in efficiency).  This
pattern continues, and FFTW's planning routines in general form a
"partial order," sequences of
interfaces with strictly increasing generality but correspondingly
greater complexity.

<p><code>fftw_plan_dft</code> is the most general complex-DFT routine that we
describe in this tutorial, but there are also the advanced and guru interfaces,
which allow one to efficiently combine multiple/strided transforms
into a single FFTW plan, transform a subset of a larger
multi-dimensional array, and/or to handle more general complex-number
formats.  For more information, see <a href="FFTW-Reference.html#FFTW%20Reference">FFTW Reference</a>.
