<h3>3.1 Data Alignment</h3>

<li><a accesskey=1 href="SIMD-alignment-and-fftw_malloc.html#SIMD%20alignment%20and%20fftw_malloc">SIMD alignment and fftw_malloc</a>: 
<li><a accesskey=2 href="Stack-alignment-on-x86.html#Stack%20alignment%20on%20x86">Stack alignment on x86</a>: 
</ul>

<p>In order to get the best performance from FFTW, one needs to be
somewhat aware of two problems related to data alignment on x86
(Pentia) architectures: alignment of allocated arrays (for use with
SIMD acceleration), and alignment of the stack.
