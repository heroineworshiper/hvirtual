<h4>5.1.2 Usage of Multi-threaded FFTW</h4>

<p>Here, it is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the usage
of the uniprocessor FFTW routines, described elsewhere in this manual. 
We only describe what one has to change in order to use the
multi-threaded routines.

<p>First, programs using the parallel complex transforms should be linked with
<code>-lfftw3_threads -lfftw3 -lm</code> on Unix. You will also need to link
with whatever library is responsible for threads on your system
(e.g. <code>-lpthread</code> on GNU/Linux).

<p>Second, before calling <em>any</em> FFTW routines, you should call the
function:

<br><pre>int fftw_init_threads(void);
</pre>

<p>This function, which need only be called once, performs any one-time
initialization required to use threads on your system.  It returns zero
if there was some error (which should not happen under normal
circumstances) and a non-zero value otherwise.

<p>Third, before creating a plan that you want to parallelize, you should
call:

<br><pre>void fftw_plan_with_nthreads(int nthreads);
</pre>

<p>The <code>nthreads</code> argument indicates the number of threads you want
FFTW to use (or actually, the maximum number).  All plans subsequently
created with any planner routine will use that many threads.  You can
call <code>fftw_plan_with_nthreads</code>, create some plans, call
<code>fftw_plan_with_nthreads</code> again with a different argument, and
create some more plans for a new number threads.  Plans already created
before a call to <code>fftw_plan_with_nthreads</code> are unaffected.  If you
pass an <code>nthreads</code> argument of <code>1</code> (the default), threads are
disabled for subsequent plans.

<p>Given a plan, you then execute it as usual with
<code>fftw_execute(plan)</code>, and the execution will use the number of
threads specified when the plan was created.  When done, you destroy it
as usual with <code>fftw_destroy_plan</code>.

<p>There is one additional routine: if you want to get rid of all memory
and other resources allocated internally by FFTW, you can call:

<br><pre>void fftw_cleanup_threads(void);
</pre>

<p>which is much like the <code>fftw_cleanup()</code> function except that it
also gets rid of threads-related data.  You must <em>not</em> execute any
previously created plans after calling this function.

<p>We should also mention one other restriction: if you save wisdom from a
program using the multi-threaded FFTW, that wisdom <em>cannot be used</em>
by a program using only the single-threaded FFTW (i.e. not calling
<code>fftw_init_threads</code>).  See <a href="Words-of-Wisdom-Saving-Plans.html#Words%20of%20Wisdom-Saving%20Plans">Words of Wisdom-Saving Plans</a>.
