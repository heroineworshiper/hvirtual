<h3>6.1 Fortran-interface routines</h3>

<p>Nearly all of the FFTW functions have Fortran-callable equivalents.  The
name of the Fortran routine is the same as that of the corresponding C
routine, but with the <code>fftw_</code> prefix replaced by <code>dfftw_</code>. 
(The single and long-double precision versions use <code>sfftw_</code> and
<code>lfftw_</code>, respectively, instead of <code>fftwf_</code> and
<code>fftwl_</code>.)<a rel=footnote href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<p>For the most part, all of the arguments to the functions are the same,
with the following exceptions:

<ul>

<li><code>plan</code> variables (what would be of type <code>fftw_plan</code> in C),
must be declared as a type that is at least as big as a pointer
(address) on your machine.  We recommend using <code>integer*8</code>.

<li>Any function that returns a value (e.g. <code>fftw_plan_dft</code>) is
converted into a <em>subroutine</em>.  The return value is converted into
an additional <em>first</em> parameter of this subroutine.<a rel=footnote href="#fn-2"><sup>2</sup></a>

<li>The Fortran routines expect multi-dimensional arrays to be in
<em>column-major</em> order, which is the ordinary format of Fortran
arrays (see <a href="Multi-dimensional-Array-Format.html#Multi-dimensional%20Array%20Format">Multi-dimensional Array Format</a>).  They do this
transparently and costlessly simply by reversing the order of the
dimensions passed to FFTW, but this has one important consequence for
multi-dimensional real-complex transforms, discussed below.

<li>Wisdom import and export is somewhat more tricky because one cannot
easily pass files or strings between C and Fortran; see <a href="Wisdom-of-Fortran-.html#Wisdom%20of%20Fortran%3f">Wisdom of Fortran?</a>.

<li>Fortran cannot use the <code>fftw_malloc</code> dynamic-allocation routine. 
If you want to exploit the SIMD FFTW (see <a href="Data-Alignment.html#Data%20Alignment">Data Alignment</a>), you'll
need to figure out some other way to ensure that your arrays are at
least 16-byte aligned.

<li>Since Fortran 77 does not have data structures, the <code>fftw_iodim</code>
structure from the guru interface (see <a href="Guru-vector-and-transform-sizes.html#Guru%20vector%20and%20transform%20sizes">Guru vector and transform sizes</a>) must be split into separate arguments.  In particular, any
<code>fftw_iodim</code> array arguments in the C guru interface become three
integer array arguments (<code>n</code>, <code>is</code>, and <code>os</code>) in the
Fortran guru interface, all of whose length should be equal to the
corresponding <code>rank</code> argument.

</ul>

<p>In general, you should take care to use Fortran data types that
correspond to (i.e. are the same size as) the C types used by FFTW.  If
your C and Fortran compilers are made by the same vendor, the
correspondence is usually straightforward (i.e. <code>integer</code>
corresponds to <code>int</code>, <code>real</code> corresponds to <code>float</code>,
etcetera).  The native Fortran double/single-precision complex type
should be compatible with <code>fftw_complex</code>/<code>fftwf_complex</code>. 
Such simple correspondences are assumed in the examples below.

<hr><h4>Footnotes</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>Technically, Fortran 77 identifiers are
not allowed to have more than 6 characters, nor may they contain
underscores.  Any compiler that enforces this limitation doesn't deserve
to link to FFTW.</p>

<li><a name="fn-2"></a>
<p>The
reason for this is that some Fortran implementations seem to have
trouble with C function return values, and vice versa.</p>
