<h2>6 Calling FFTW from Fortran</h2>

<p>This chapter describes the Fortran-callable interface to FFTW, which
differs from the C interface only in the prefix (<code>dfftw_</code> instead
of <code>fftw_</code>), and a few other minor details.  The Fortran interface
is included in the FFTW libraries by default, unless a Fortran compiler
isn't found on your system or <code>--disable-fortran</code> is included in
the <code>configure</code> flags.  We assume here that the reader is already
familiar with the usage of FFTW in C, as described elsewhere in this
manual.
