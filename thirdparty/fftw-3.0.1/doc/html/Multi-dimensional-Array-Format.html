<h3>3.2 Multi-dimensional Array Format</h3>

<p>This section describes the format in which multi-dimensional arrays
are stored in FFTW.  We felt that a detailed discussion of this topic
was necessary.  Since several different formats are common, this topic
is often a source of confusion among users.
