<h2>5 Parallel FFTW</h2>

<p>In this chapter we discuss the use of FFTW in a parallel environment.

<p>Currently, FFTW 3 includes parallel transforms for shared-memory
machiens with some flavor of threads (e.g. POSIX threads); any program
using FFTW can be trivially modified to use these transforms, which are
documented in <a href="Multi-threaded-FFTW.html#Multi-threaded%20FFTW">Multi-threaded FFTW</a>.

<p>Users calling FFTW from a multi-threaded program should also consult
<a href="Thread-safety.html#Thread%20safety">Thread safety</a>.  This section tells you which routines of FFTW it
is safe to call in parallel from different shared-memory threads.

<p>FFTW 2 also contains distributed-memory parallel transforms using the
MPI message-passing standard.  MPI transforms are not yet available in
FFTW 3, so users requiring that capability must use FFTW 2 for now.
