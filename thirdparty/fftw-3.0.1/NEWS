FFTW 3.0.1

* Some speed improvements in SIMD code.

* --without-cycle-counter option is removed.  If no cycle counter is found,
  then the estimator is always used.  A --with-slow-timer option is provided
  to force the use of lower-resolution timers.

* Several fixes for compilation under Visual C++, with help from Stefane Ruel.

* Added x86 cycle counter for Visual C++, with help from Morten Nissov.

* Added S390 cycle counter, courtesy of James Treacy.

* Added missing static keyword that prevented simultaneous linkage
  of different-precision versions; thanks to Rasmus Larson for the bug report.

* Corrected accidental omission of f77_wisdom.f file; thanks to Alan Watson.

* Support -xopenmp flag for SunOS; thanks to John Lou for the bug report.

* Compilation with HP/UX cc requires -Wp,-H128000 flag to increase
  preprocessor limits; thanks to Peter Vouras for the bug report.

* Removed non-portable use of 'tempfile' in fftw-wisdom-to-conf script;
  thanks to Nicolas Decoster for the patch.

* Added 'make smallcheck' target in tests/ directory, at the request of
  James Treacy.

FFTW 3.0

Major goals of this release:

* Speed: often 20% or more faster than FFTW 2.x, even without SIMD (see below).

* Complete rewrite, to make it easier to add new algorithms and transforms.

* New API, to support more general semantics.

Other enhancements:

* SIMD acceleration on supporting CPUs (SSE, SSE2, 3DNow!, and AltiVec).
 (With special thanks to Franz Franchetti for many experimental prototypes
  and to Stefan Kral for the vectorizing generator from fftwgel.)

* True in-place 1d transforms of large sizes (as well as compressed
  twiddle tables for additional memory/cache savings).

* More arbitrary placement of real & imaginary data, e.g. including
  interleaved (as in FFTW 2.x) as well as separate real/imag arrays.

* Efficient prime-size transforms of real data.

* Multidimensional transforms can operate on a subset of a larger matrix,
  and/or transform selected dimensions of a multidimensional array.

* By popular demand, simultaneous linking to double precision (fftw),
  single precision (fftwf), and long-double precision (fftwl) versions
  of FFTW is now supported.

* Cycle counters (on all modern CPUs) are exploited to speed planning.

* Efficient transforms of real even/odd arrays, a.k.a. discrete
  cosine/sine transforms (types I-IV).  (Currently work via pre/post
  processing of real transforms, ala FFTPACK, so are not optimal.)

* DHTs (Discrete Hartley Transforms), again via post-processing
  of real transforms (and thus suboptimal, for now).

* Support for linking to just those parts of FFTW that you need,
  greatly reducing the size of statically linked programs when
  only a limited set of transform sizes/types are required.

* Canonical global wisdom file (/etc/fftw/wisdom) on Unix, along
  with a command-line tool (fftw-wisdom) to generate/update it.

* Fortran API can be used with both g77 and non-g77 compilers
  simultaneously.

* Multi-threaded version has optional OpenMP support.

* Authors' good looks have greatly improved with age.

Changes from 3.0beta3:

* Separate FMA distribution to better exploit fused multiply-add instructions
  on PowerPC (and possibly other) architectures.

* Performance improvements via some inlining tweaks.

* fftw_flops now returns double arguments, not int, to avoid overflows
  for large sizes.

* Workarounds for automake bugs.

Changes from 3.0beta2:

* The standard REDFT00/RODFT00 (DCT-I/DST-I) algorithm (used in
  FFTPACK, NR, etcetera) turns out to have poor numerical accuracy, so
  we replaced it with a slower routine that is more accurate.

* The guru planner and execute functions now have two variants, one that
  takes complex arguments and one that takes separate real/imag pointers.

* Execute and planner routines now automatically align the stack on x86,
  in case the calling program is misaligned.

* README file for test program.

* Fixed bugs in the combination of SIMD with multi-threaded transforms.

* Eliminated internal fftw_threads_init function, which some people were
  calling accidentally instead of the fftw_init_threads API function.

* Check for -openmp flag (Intel C compiler) when --enable-openmp is used.

* Support AMD x86-64 SIMD and cycle counter.

* Support SSE2 intrinsics in forthcoming gcc 3.3.

Changes from 3.0beta1:

* Faster in-place 1d transforms of non-power-of-two sizes.

* SIMD improvements for in-place, multi-dimensional, and/or non-FFTW_PATIENT
  transforms.

* Added support for hard-coded DCT/DST/DHT codelets of small sizes; the
  default distribution only includes hard-coded size-8 DCT-II/III, however.

* Many minor improvements to the manual.  Added section on using the
  codelet generator to customize and enhance FFTW.

* The default 'make check' should now only take a few minutes; for more
  strenuous tests (which may take a day or so), do 'cd tests; make bigcheck'.

* fftw_print_plan is split into fftw_fprint_plan and fftw_print_plan, where
  the latter uses stdout.

* Fixed ability to compile with a C++ compiler.

* Fixed support for C99 complex type under glibc.

* Fixed problems with alloca under MinGW, AIX.

* Workaround for gcc/SPARC bug.

* Fixed multi-threaded initialization failure on IRIX due to lack of
  user-accessible PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM there.
