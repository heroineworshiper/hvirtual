For the broadest possible support for OJPEG files the following steps are 
necessary:

 o Ensure you are able to build with JPEG support (see config.site).

 o #define OJPEG_SUPPORT somewhere.  This can be put in tiffconf.h for
   instance.

 o Append the jdhuff_add.c code to the end of jdhuff.c within the IJG JPEG
   libraries jdhuff.c file and recompile libjpeg (jpeg-6b tested).

 o Rebuild cleanly.


OJPEG support implemented by Scott Marovich at HP (marovich@hpl.hp.com).
