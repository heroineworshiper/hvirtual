	INSTALL.real which autoconf will leave alone.

Linux MPEG/MJPEG Audio/Video tools - MJPEG TOOLS
================================================

The mjpegtools are a set of utilities for video-decoding, -recording,
-playback, -editing and -encoding. Most parts of this software are
distributed under the terms of the Gnu Public License (GPL). See
the individual source files for the exact terms.  Mjpegtools is known to build 
and install on Linux, BSD and OS/X.  On other systems you are on yor own - maybe
you'll be lucky.

REQUIRED/RECOMMENDED SOFTWARE
=============================
For compiling the mjpegtools you will at least need the following
pieces of software:

glib           : http://www.gtk.org/
(g)cc/g++/c++  : http://gcc.gnu.org/ 
libjpeg        : http://www.ijg.org/
XFree86        : http://www.xfree86.org/

These are almost always included with every distribution.

However, with this, many of the tools and many features of the tools
will not be compiled by default. The following software is advised
for getting the extra features of the mjpegtools:

Gtk+           : http://www.gtk.org/
libDV          : http://libdv.sourceforge.net/
SDL            : http://www.libsdl.org/

Some of these are not installed by default with some distributions. If any
of them are not found this will be logged during the ./configure process.

COMPILING SUPPORT LIBRARIES
===========================
The following library is highly recommended for compiling the mjpegtools:

libquicktime   : http://libquicktime.sourceforge.net/

Lastly unpack libquicktime and run './configure', 'make' and 'make install'.
As usual when installing new libraries it may be necessary to run 'ldconfig' 
after 'make install'.

COMPILING THE MJPEGTOOLS
========================
Unpack the tarball and run './autogen.sh' to create the configure script.  In
the simplest form the configure script is run like this:

	./configure

If you do NOT want to include quicktime support you may specify 
'--with-quicktime=no', otherwise the presence of libquicktime will be 
autodetected.  This is not recommended since Quicktime is a very useful 
format.

You can possibly use other options, such as '--enable-large-file' to enable 
support for > 2GB file support.  This is NOT needed by default since autoconf
automatically generates the checks for largefile support.  Binaries compiled 
with large file support will *not* run on systems lacking large file support!  
Next, run 'make' and 'make install'. You're now ready to use the mjpegtools!
The MJPEG HOWTO (mjpeg_howto.txt or 'man mjpegtools') is a good place to start.
