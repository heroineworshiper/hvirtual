(Gernot Ziegler speaking)
These are some of my new ideas, I don't know if I am going to realize them - ever:

.) Plugins for GIMP

.) Blender output plugin

  -> 22 kHz, 11kHz reading functions ... 
  -> multiplexing functions

.) "Normal" read/write support (position in the file, and then 
    start writing over there (needs a new internal writing position info))

.) (frozen because of assumed low demand)
   Read/write support with a special feature: 
   If the new written frame is smaller than the old one, preserve the old 
   filestructure, and mark the rest of the unused old filespace as "junk", 
   which can be reused the next time -> allows a new kind of clipping
   in without having to render a new movie all the time . 
   
   Long, in the far distant future:
   Program a Virtual File system with these features

mjpeg:

.) Real support for interlaced playback

.) Hardware YUV-RGB-conversion ? 

.) jpeg compression


(Andrew Stevens speaking)

.) Proper integration of the output patches into the ac3dec and
mpeg2dec code-bases.  Construction of a title extraction tool for
reading DVD's (based on dxr2 code-base)?

.) Support for SSE instructions on Pentium-III. 

.) Scene change detection and dynamic GOP structure adjustment.

.) Support for parallel encoding on multi-CPU machines.

.) Optimisation of	DCT/iDCT to avoid unnecessary transpositions?
