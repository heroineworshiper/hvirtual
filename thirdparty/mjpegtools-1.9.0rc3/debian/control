Description: MJPEG video capture/editting/playback runtime libraries
 This package contains shared libraries for mjpeg programs.
 .
 The mjpeg programs are a set of tools that can do recording of videos
 and playback, simple cut-and-paste editing and the MPEG compression of
 audio and video under Linux.  This package combines them with
 important supporting libraries required for their use.
 .
 The "lavrec" utility supplied supports capture from
 Zoran based MJPEG capture/playback cards like the Buz
 (Iomega), DC10 (MIRO, Pinnacle) and the LML33 (Linux Media Labs).
 Compatible MJPEG avi files can also be created using any frame-grabbing
 card supported by the xawtv tool.
 .
 Videos recorded in this can be filtered, editted, and converted to
 MPEG streams. The MPEG encoder is optimised for high quality results
 at medium to high bit-rates (1Mbps upwards) and supports MMX/SSE/3D-Now
 and SMP.  A Duron 700 can deliver around 15-20 352x288 frames per second.
 .
 A key design objective of the tools is interoperability with other
 video tools: currently xawtv, bcast2000, nuppelvideo and vcdimager
 are known to interoperate. The MJPEG utilities can read AVI, Quicktime,
 and movtar streams. The MPEG encoder can produce streams
 suitable for buring to VCD/SVCD using vcdimager or similar tools.
 The software playback of MPEG streams works with almost
 every player and every OS. SSE/MMX and 3D-Now!  are supported permitting
 a 700Mhz CPU to deliver arond 15-20 VCD frames/second.
