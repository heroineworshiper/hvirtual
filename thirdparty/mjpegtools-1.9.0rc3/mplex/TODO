TODO

-Fix the bug with excessibe run-in in AC3 with small packets (no buffering time limit) validate using stereo-96-1min-1st-five.tar.gz


- Replace the stream-specific ReadPacketPayload stuff with
  proper AUMuxed StreamHeaderSize based stuff

- Replace the current peak rate estimation with one based on
monitoring SCR and position in original stream every so-and-so many
muxed out frames...

- Support for muxing subtitles...


- Reduce use of muxinto.<global> by encapsulating run-out info...

- Complete encapsulation by utilising stream interface rather than
  direct access to C-style file I/O 

- Need to add general facility for enforcing max STD buffer delay for audio
  and for warning if constraints for particular formats are exceeded.

- Add checking for changed sequence parameters in mid-sequence
	sequence headers.

- Currently the VCD HR Stills muxing stuff assumes *all* HR stills
  are the same size which is given in the initial vbv_buffer_size...
  This will work with mpeg2enc (which does this) but will fail fail fail
  with other streams.

- Rebuild initial delay / sequence splitting DTS adjustment stuff so
  different streams can have different starting delays based on
  *stream* parameters.  I.e. delay should be delegated to the elementary
  streams with only a sector_prefix offset set centrally.

- Tidy code so Elementary streams handle their mux parameter initialisation
	from cmd-line parameters *not* the output stream.


Eventually:

- Multi-channel SVCD (MPEG audio extension) support. N.b. multi-track
  two-channel audio already works.

- DVD muxing and generation of info to help authoring tools produce .IFO's etc.
