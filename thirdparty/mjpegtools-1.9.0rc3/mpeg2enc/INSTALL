Additional Notes on compilation and installation

SSE/MMX Support

The top-level ./configure script should automatically turn on the inclusion of
SSE/MMX routines for x86 processors.

Note that the .o files for MMX and SSE are included as well
as the assembly language source.  This should save hassle for those who can't
be bothered with the job of installing nasm. The files are tiny...
