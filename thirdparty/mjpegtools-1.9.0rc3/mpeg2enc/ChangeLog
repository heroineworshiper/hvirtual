		Added more intelligent motion compensation search.
		Basically, the program now first does a coarse search
		based on 2*2 pel squares, comparing intensity sums.
		Since a good match (low difference) here can be
		expected to correlated with a good 1 and 1/2 pel match
		it uses only the best fraction (default 1/10th) of these
		as starting points for more expensive 1 pel search.  The
		best 1 pel match is then used as the basis for a best
		1/2 pel match.


		Integrated SSE/MMX code based on original contribution
		by Chris Atenasio.  N.b. see INSTALL for details
		of compilation with SSE/MMX.
	
2000 Jul/Aug	Lots to add - see README for the summary...

2003		A.Stevens
		Shifted to C++ replaced original phase oriented processing
		with macro-block oriented processing.
