	audio/video from mjpeg.

	* Initial support for transcoding using patched mpeg2dec and
	ac3dec packages.

	mpeg2enc. Bugs fixed. Run-time selection of MMX/extended
	MMX/SSE/3D-Now! routines as appropriate.

	* mplex now much faster, debugged, and supports correct VCD
	compatible multiplexing and splitting of streams into multiple files.
	Initial MPEG-2 video support.  Supports layer 3 audio and (hopefully)
	MPEG audio V2 and V2.5 though these don't look too useful...

        * Bug fixes and support for software-only playback of mjpeg.

Revision 1.14  2001/07/08 21:21:15  wackston
Added VBR audio support.
Fixed wav headers so they indicate a long not a short stream
if header is aborted...

Revision 1.13  2001/06/23 14:14:41  wackston
First stage of single-pass muxing.  Video now single-pass.

Revision 1.12  2001/05/26 12:37:50  wackston
Tidying doco for packaging...

Revision 1.11  2001/05/10 19:52:36  wackston
Tidyings and fixing up to the 1.4 release.

Revision 1.10  2001/05/06 15:59:15  wackston
Bug fix for m/c type select in motion.c  also made field M/C use
chroma info.

Minor fixes elewhere related consistenct logging / command lines.

Revision 1.9  2001/02/07 14:45:05  wackston
Minor tidyings and bug-fixes ready for 1.3b3 release.

Revision 1.8  2001/01/25 20:11:29  wackston

Tagging for beta2 release.

Revision 1.5  2000/12/15 19:34:09  wackston
MPEG-2 encoding has been restored to working order. Still some doubts about
whether its 100% correct again but as far as I can tell any remaining bugs are just sub-optimality rather than crass errors.

mplex now support MPEG-2 mux-ing *and* layer 3 audio.

Revision 1.4  2000/12/07 19:09:04  wackston
