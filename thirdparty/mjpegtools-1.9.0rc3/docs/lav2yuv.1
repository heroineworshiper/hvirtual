.SH "NAME"
lav2yuv \- Convert a MJPEG file to raw yuv

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B lav2yuv
.RI [ options ]
.I lavfile1 \fP[\fIlavfile2 \fP...\fI lavfileN\fP]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBlav2yuv\fP converts an MJPEG video sequence described by a sequence
of MJPEG video files and/or edit lists pointing to such files into the
simple uncompressed planar 4:2:0 Y'CbCr format, as used by \fBmpeg2enc\fP(1) 
MPEG encoder and image processing filters like
\fByuvscaler\fP(1) or \fByuv2dfilter\fP(1) or \fByuvdenoise\fP(1).

Output is to stdout so that by piping the output of lav2yuv into a
suitable pipeline it is possible to process and then encode or play
back video recorded in any of the mjpegtools MJPEG container formats:
AVI, quicktime or edit lists describing editted versions of
video held in such files.

Mixing different files with different video formats is currently not possible.

The \fB\-S \-T \-D\fP options are used for scene detection
which is used by linux video studio.

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBlav2yuv\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.BI \-m 
Force mono\-chrome
.TP 5
.BI \-c 
Conceal frames containing corrupt MJPEG data by repeating the
preceeding good frame.
.TP 5
.BI \-S " list.el"
Output a scene list with scene detection
.TP 5
.BI \-T " num"
Set scene detection threshold to num (default: 4)
.TP 5
.BI \-D " num"
Width decimation to use for scene detection (default: 2)
.TP 5
.BI \-o " num"
Frame offset \- skip \fInum\fP frames at the beginning.  if \fInum\fP is negative
all but the last \fInum\fP frames are skipped
.TP 5
.BI \-f " num"
Only \fInum\fP frames are written to stdout. 0 means that all frames are processed. 
.TP 5
.BI \-A \ width:height
Set/override the sample aspect ratio (SAR) emitted in the output stream
header.  Currently, the SAR is only auto-detected for DV files, and
guessed otherwise.
.TP 5
.BI \-P \ width:height
Set the intended/approximate display aspect ratio (DAR) for the stream.
This value is only used to guess the SAR when it cannot be detected 
from the input stream.  The default DAR is '4:3' (corresponding to a
standard TV screen); another useful value is '16:9' (corresponding to
widescreen TV).
.TP 5
.BI \-C \ chroma
Set output chroma (default: '420jpeg').
Currently, '420jpeg', '420mpeg2', '420paldv', '422' are available.
.TP 5
.BI \-x
Exchange fields.  Useful if the field order was reversed during editing.
