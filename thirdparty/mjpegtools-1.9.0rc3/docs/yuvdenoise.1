.SH NAME
yuvdenoise \- Motion-Compensating-YUV4MPEG2-frame-denoiser

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yuvdenoise
.RI [ options ]
.RI "</dev/stdin >/dev/stdout"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByuvdenoise\fP is a spatio\-temporal noise\-filter for
YUV4MPEG2 streams. This is useful to reduce the bitrate       
needed to encode your captured movies for VCD and SVCD creation.

.SH OPTIONS
\fByuvdenoise\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 4
.BI \-g " y,u,v [0..255] Gaussian filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the gaussian filter.  A value of 
0 disables filtering for a specific component and 0,0,0 completely 
disables/bypasses the filter.  This filter is applied \fBbefore\fP the 
temporal (\-t) filter.
.br
(default=0,0,0)

.TP 4
.BI \-m " y,u,v [0..255] Pre 3D Median filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the pre-processing 3D median filter.  A value of 
0 disables median filtering for a specific component and 0,0,0 completely 
disables/bypasses the filter.  This filter is applied \fBbefore\fP the 
temporal (\-t) filter.
.br
(default=0,0,0)

.TP 4
.BI \-r " y,u,v [0..255] Renoising filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for adding random "noise" back into the video stream.
Default is disabled (not adding random noise).  This filter, if enabled, is
run as the \fPBlast\fP filter (after the median and temporal filters).  
Reasonable value is 4,8,8 but if you are working with monochrome (black and
white movie) then 4,0,0 will speed things up by not processing the chroma
planes.
.br
(default=0,0,0)

.TP 4
.BI \-t " y,u,v [0..255] Temporal noise\-filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the temporal noise\-filter.
Values above 12 may introduce ghosting.  The default value for Y' (y)
is often a little high and reducing it to 4 or 5 may be necessary.  If the
chroma smears or ghosts try using values of 5 or 6 instead of the default (12).
A value of 0 disables temporal filtering for the specified component (0,0,0
disables/bypasses all temporal filtering).  Thus for black and white movies
4,0,0 will be faster by not denoising the chroma planes.
.br
(default=4,8,8)

.TP 4
.BI \-M " y,u,v [0..255] Post 3D Median filter thresholds"
This sets the thresholds for the post-processing 3D median filter.  A value of 
0 disables median filtering for a specific component and 0,0,0 completely 
disables/bypasses the filter.  This filter is applied \fBafter\fP the 
temporal (\-t) filter.
Reasonable value is 4,8,8 but if you are working with monochrome (black and
white movie) then 4,0,0 will speed things up by not processing the chroma
planes.

(default=0,0,0)

.SH HOW IT WORKS
To Be Written (maybe) in the future.

.SH TYPICAL USAGE AND TIPS
As it is self-adapting to the noise-situation found in the stream you
normally just can go without any options set:
