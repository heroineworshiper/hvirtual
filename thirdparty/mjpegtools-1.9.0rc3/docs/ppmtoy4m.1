.SH "NAME"
ppmtoy4m \- Convert PPM images to YUV4MPEG2 stream

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ppmtoy4m
.RI [ options ]
.I [ filename ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBppmtoy4m\fP converts one or more raw PPM images into a YUV4MPEG2 stream
ready for further processing by other video tools.

Output is to stdout to facilitate piping to other MJPEG tools.
The size of the output frame(s) is determined from the (first) input image.

Input is a 'raw' format PPM image, read from stdin or from the optional
filename.  The input may contain multiple PPM images concatenated together;
\fBppmtoy4m\fP will read and process them sequentially.  All images must have
identical size and format.  Input images can be interpreted as whole
progressive frames, interleaved fields, or (in pairs) as sequential fields.
The input images must have 8 bits per channel (i.e. 'maxval' must be 255).

Input images should be in the usual R'G'B' colorspace.  They are converted
to the Y'CbCr colorspace (ITU-R BT.601) (and chroma subsampled, if desired)
before output.

\fBppmtoy4m\fP and \fBy4mtoppm\fP are inverses of each other; you can
pipe the output of one into the other, and vice-versa.  Note that the
subsampling and colorspace operations are lossy in both directions.  And,
when converting to PPM, information on interlacing and sample aspect ratio
is lost (but can be reconstructed by supplying command-line arguments to
\fBppmtoy4m\fP).


.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBppmtoy4m\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.BI \-o " num"
Frame offset:  skip output of the first 'num' frames.  (default: 0)
.TP 5
.BI \-n " num"
Output a total of 'num' output frames.  Use '0' to specify all frames.
(default: 0)
.TP 5
.BI \-F " n:d"
Set framerate encoded in output stream, as an exact integer ratio.
(default:  30000:1001)  Common rates are:
 24000:1001 - NTSC 3:2 pulldown converted film
       24:1 - native film
       25:1 - PAL/SECAM
 30000:1001 - NTSC video
       50:1 - PAL field rate
 60000:1001 - NTSC field rate
.TP 5
.BI \-A " n:d"
Set pixel aspect ratio encoded in output stream, as an exact integer ratio.
(default:  1:1)  Common ratios are:
     1:1  - square pixels (computer graphics)
    10:11 - CCIR-601 NTSC
    59:54 - CCIR-601 PAL
.TP 5
.BI \-B
Interpret data as being BGR rather than RGB.
.TP 5
.BI \-I " x"
Set interlacing mode, used to interpret the PPM image(s), and also encoded
in output stream.  (default:  'p')
 p - progressive, non-interlaced
 t - top/upper-field-first interlaced
 b - bottom/lower-field-first interlaced
.TP 5
.BI \-L
For interlaced streams, treat each PPM image as two interleaved fields.
(Otherwise, two PPM images will be read for each frame; one per field.)
.TP 5
.BI \-r 
Repeat last input frame until output is complete.  If '-n 0' is also specified,
last input frame will be repeated forever.
.TP 5
.BI \-S " mode"
Set chroma subsampling mode.  (default:  444)
       444 - 4:4:4 (no subsampling)
   420jpeg - 4:2:0 JPEG/MPEG-1, interstitial cositing 
  420mpeg2 - 4:2:0 MPEG-2, horizontal cositing

The subsampled modes use a lousy subsampling filter;
better results will be achieved by passing the default 4:4:4 output to
a scaler which supports subsampling, such as \fBy4mscaler\fP(1).
.TP 5
.BI \-v " [0,1,2]"
Set verbosity level.  
 0 = warnings and errors only.
 1 = add informative messages, too.
 2 = add chatty debugging message, too.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.hw ppmtoy4m yuvplay tgatoppm
To convert a file containing a single PPM file into a stream of 15
(identical) frames:

.RS 5
ppmtoy4m -n 15 -r some-image.ppm
.RE

To convert a series of Targa format images (in the current directory)
to a YUV4MPEG2 stream displayed by yuvplay:

.RS 5
ls *.tga | xargs -n1 tgatoppm | ppmtoy4m | yuvplay
.RE
