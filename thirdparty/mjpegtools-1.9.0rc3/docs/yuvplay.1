.SH NAME
yuvplay \- Display YUV4MPEG2 streams (using SDL)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B yuvplay
.RB [ options ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fByuvplay\fP produces on-screen playback of a YUV4MPEG2 stream
which is provided to stdin, typically through piping from the stdout of
\fBlavpipe\fP(1), \fBlav2yuv\fP(1), \fBmpeg2dec\fP(1) or a similar
program.  It should be noted that for pure
playback lavplay should be a superior option.  yuvplay is intended
primarily as a debugging or diagnostic utility when setting up video
processing pipelines.  

.SH OPTIONS
\fByuvplay\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.BI \-s \ WxH
The size of the SDL window.  By default, it uses the size of the 
input video stream scaled to yield 1:1 pixels (using the sample aspect ratio
encoded in the stream header).
However, you can specify any size you want.
WxH is the width x height of the scaled window.

.TP 8
.BI \-t title
Set the window title.

.TP 8
.BI \-f " num"
Override the framerate specified in the input stream header.

.TP 8
.BI \-c
By default, yuvplay will try to play at the framerate of the input movie.
With this option, yuvplay will just play all the frames as fast as it can.

.TP 8
.BI \-v \ [0, 1, 2]
Set the verbosity of user feedback.  Default is "1":  errors, warnings, and
info messages.
