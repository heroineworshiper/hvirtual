.SH "NAME"
yuvinactive \- Set a part of the video to a defined state

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B yuvinactive
.RI [ options ]
.I </dev/stdin >/dev/stdout

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fByuvinactive\fP operates with a area (rectangle) you define. 
By default is sets it to really black. But you can tell tell yuvinactive
to darken the area, or fill it with a certain color. It can also make the
content of the area unreadable, like extreme softening of the area. 
Or copy the surrounding area into the the specified area.  
You usually have to use the -i option which sets the area in which yuvinactive
will work. If no additional option is given yuvinactive stet the area to black.
But you can use the \fB-d -s -a -c options\fP to tell yuvinactive that it
shall do something different with that area. You can only use one additional
option. yuvinactive was built to remove unwanted things like a logo, from the
movie. 

.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBlav2yuv\fP accepts the following options:

.TP 5
.BI \-h
Some help output
.TP 5
.BI \-i "XxY+XOFF+YOFF"
Specifies the area yuvinactive shall work with. With this option the area
is set to black. There are no restrictions because of interlacing. 
.TP 5
.BI \-d " num"
How much darker the area should be compared to the original color.
This is done by setting a lower value for the luma. The value is in percent
from the original luma. 
.TP 5
.BI \-s " num"
Here you specify a certain color in the yuv format. 
.TP 5
.BI \-a " num"
With this option the program uses on pixel and averages the surrounding 
pixels with the same color to make the original less readable. 
The number tells the the program how much pixels around the original 
pixel should be overwritten with the same color. You have to use a even number
here
.TP 5
.BI \-c " num"
Sets the number of surrounding pixels yuvinactive should use to copy them into
the given area. You have to use a even number here. yuvinactive uses the lines
above and below the specified area for copying them into the area. 

.SH "BUGS"
Right, there are bugs hidden. The thing is not well tested, and not every 
option might work. yuvinactive is in the first state of becoming a useful
program.
