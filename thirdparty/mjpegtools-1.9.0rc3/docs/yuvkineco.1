.SH DESCRIPTION
.br
\fByuvkineco\fP reverts to original non\-interlaced frames,
from NTSC video which was film sourced and 2\-3 pulled down.
Input fps code must be 4(29.97fps), output fps code can be selected
from 1(23.97fps) to 4(29.97fps). If 2, 3 or 4 selected, duplicated 
frames remain but they are reverted to non\-interlaced.
If input was non\-interlaced only remove duplicate frames.
Interlaced frame detection may fail in conditions like:
    Pull down cycle changed (video editing).
    Low quality pull down.
    Motionless scene.
.br
If \fB\-C\fP \fIPATH\fP was specified, \fByuvkineco\fP outputs 2\-3 pull down
cycle list to the file.  You can edit this file by hand and feed it
to \fByuvkineco\fP with \fB\-O\fP or \fB\-N\fP option to correct mistake 
of 1st \fByuvkineco\fP.
Try \fB\-C\fP and see cycle list.

.SH OPTIONS
\fByuvkineco\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.BI \-F \ FPSCODE
Set output fps code (default: same as input).
.TP 8
.BI \-C \ PATH
Specify 2-3 pull down cycle list file name to write.
.TP 8
.BI \-O \ PATH
Specify cycle list name to read with old yuv stream to retry.
.TP 8
.BI \-N \ PATH
Specify cycle list name to read with new yuv stream to repair.
.TP 8
.BI \-S \ MIN
Use \fByuvycsnoise\fP(1) as preprocessor and specify minimum threshold.
.TP 8
.BI \-n \ LEVEL
Specify noise level of input (default: 10).
This affects both pulldown cycle detection and deinterlacing.
.TP 8
.BI \-c \ THRESHOLD
Specify threshold to decide pictures in 2 frames are same (default: 4).
\fByuvkineco\fP compares several frames,
searches pair of frame they contain same pictures,
to decide which frame should be dropped.
If \fITHRESHOLD\fP is 0,
pair which has smallest difference will be selected.
If 16, selected from pairs those have differences smaller than average.
.TP 8
.BI \-i \ PERMIL
\fByuvkineco\fP deinterlaces each frame after 2\-3 pulldown reverting
process, specify how much pixels deinterlaced to decide to use
or not use deinterlacing result (default: 10). 
If \fIPERMIL\fP is 10 and 1% or more of pixels deinterlaced, 
deinterlacing result will be used.
If 0, always deinterlacing result will be used.
If 1000, deinterlacing result will not be used,
but deinterlacing process will run on all of frames.
To disable deinterlacing process, specify negative value.
.TP 8
.BI \-u
Set interlace information in header of output to unknown
(default: non\-interlaced).
