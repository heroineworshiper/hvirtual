.SH NAME
lav2mpeg \- easy conversion of lav files to mpeg
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lav2mpeg [ options ]
.I lavfile1 [lavfile2 ... lavfileN]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lav2mpeg
is a shell script to ease the use of the mjpeg utilities, providing a 
convenient way to convert from MJPEG files to popular MPEG file formats.
It supports output in VCD, medium and high rate VCD, SVCD, high rate
SVCD, and generic mpeg1 and mpeg2
.LP 
The input files may be any combination of AVI (.avi),
Quicktime (.qt) or editlist files so long as they are all lavtools\-
readable (e.g. MJPEG-encoded AVI/Quicktime or DV type 2 AVI).

.IP -o 
output file  ( defaults to firstInputFileName.mpg )
.IP -b 
video bitrate in kbps  ( only used when -o is "mpeg1" or "mpeg2" )

.SH FILES
.I ~/.lav2mpegrc
.RS
user configuration file. It is bash sourceable, and can modify any of
the environment variables mentioned in the ENVIRONMENT section, or set
the LAV2MPEG_OPTIONS variable to add default options.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP NICEVAL 
the nice value of each command, set using 'nice -n command'
.IP YUVSCALER 
modify which command is called for yuvscaler
.IP LAV2WAV 
modify which command is called for lav2wav
.IP MPLEX 
modify which command is called for mplex
.IP YUVDENOISE 
modify which command is called for yuvdenoise
.IP MPEG2ENC 
modify which command is called for mpeg2enC
.IP AUDIOENC 
audioenc is similar to those above, however, if it is set to 'mp2enc' it will use mp2enc rather than toolame, and set flags appropriotely.
.IP NOISYLOGFILE 
set the file used for noisy logging (-N) defaults to outputfile.log
.IP QUIETLOG
set the file used for quiet logging. defaults to lav2mpeg.log if set to "" it will log only to screen
.IP LOGDATE
defaults to 1, set to 0 to not have the date logged in log or output (see man date for more info)
.IP LOGDATESTR
will pass this on to 'date' to describe what time format to use.  Only used if LOGDATE is not 0
.IP LOGCOMMANDS
if set to non-zero, will log to the quite log the commands used.  Commands are always logged to NOISYLOGFILE if used
.IP LOGONLY
if set to non-zero, will only log the commands it would use but not actually run any commands
.IP LAV2MPEGRC
the lav2mpegrc file.  Only beneficial if set from environment variable.
.IP VCD_MEDIUM_BR
video bitrate for mode=vcd_medium
.IP VCD_HIGH_BR
video bitrate for mode=vcd_high
.IP SVCD_HIGH_BR
video bitrate for mode=svcd_high
.IP SVCD_HIGH_QUAL
quality used (-q 0-30 to mpeg2enc) for SVCD_HIGH
.IP SVCD_HIGH_BUFFSIZE
buffsize (-V to mpeg2enc) used for svcd_high defaults to 100
.IP EXTRA_LAV2YUV
set extra command line arguments to lav2yuv, which will be added on the end
.IP EXTRA_YUVSCALER
set extra command line arguments to yuvscaler, which will be added on the end
.IP EXTRA_MPEG2ENC
set extra command line arguments to mpeg2enc, which will be added on the end
.IP EXTRA_LAV2WAV
set extra command line arguments to lav2wav, which will be added on the end
.IP EXTRA_AUDIOENC
set extra command line arguments to mp2enc or toolame (depending on AUDIOENC), which will be added on the end
.IP EXTRA_MPLEX
set extra command line arguments to mplex, which will be added on the end
.IP EXTRA_YUVDENOISE
set extra command line arguments to yuvdenoise, which will be added on the end
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
To simply see the commands that lav2mpeg would have called, run 'LOGONLY=1 lav2mpeg ...'

.SH EXAMPLES
.nf 
create a VCD compliant mpeg regardless of input named file.mpg
.ft B
lav2mpeg file.avi
.ft R

create a SVCD high rate mpeg from input named out.mpg
.ft B
lav2mpeg -o out.mpg -m svcd_high file.avi
.ft R

use lav2yuv.new for instead of lav2yuv, and add the '-M MMX' flag to
yuvscaler:
.ft B
LAV2YUV="lav2yuv.new" EXTRA_YUVSCALER="-M MMX" lav2mpeg file.avi
.ft R
