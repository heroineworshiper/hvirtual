.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Mp2enc is a simple MPEG-1 layer-I/II audio encoder.  It is actually a very
mildly warmed over version of the MPEG Software Simulation Group's
reference encoder.  It accepts a WAV file or stream on stdin and
ouputs an a layer-I/II elementary audio stream.  It is included in the
\fBmjpegtools\fP(1) primarily for reasons of completeness and because it
is able to perform sampling rate conversion.
.PP
Those seeking a faster (and probably higher quality) layer II encoder are
recommended to use \fBtoolame\fP(1) which can be obtained from:

.SH "GENERAL FUNCTION LETTERS"
.TP
.BI -o \ output_filename
Specifies the name for the output file.

An integer format code (e.g. %d) in the name is replaced the number of
the file generated (see printf(3)).
.TP
.BI -v \ num
Set verbosity level to num.  0 = warnings and errors only, 1 = information as well, 2=really verbose.
.B -?
Display a synopsis of the command syntax.

.TP
.BI -R \ rate,chans,bits
Indicate, that the input is raw PCM without header. You must specify 3
numbers: rate is the samplerate in Hz, chans is the number of channels
(1 or 2) and bits is the number of bits per sample. 8 bits are unsigned,
16 bits are signed in machine native byte order.

.br
.SH "FUNCTION LETTERS CONTROLLING OUTPUT STREAM STRUCTURE"
.TP
.BI -b \ bitrate

This sets the bit-rate of the output stream in kBit/sec.  Typical
values for layer II might be 224kbps for good-quality audio suitable for capturing
Dolby pro-logic signals.  A rate of 192kbps or 128kbps is reasonable
for low quality audio (e.g. mono TV audio).  Really high compression
is, of course, better achieved using MPEG-1 layer III ("MP3") audio
encoding or AAC. A more appropriate value for layer I might be 384kbps.

.TP
.BI -r \ sampling_rate
Sets the audio sampling rate of the reconstructed output signal in Hz.
Legal values are 32000, 44100 and 48000Hz.   mp2enc will automatically
sample-rate convert the input signal if necessary.

.TP
.BI -l \ layer
Sets the audio layer.
Legal values are 1 and 2. The default is layer II.

.TP
.BI -s
Force stereo output.  A mono input signal is channel doubled before
encoding to make it stereo.  This is useful for players
which simply can't handle a non-stero signal.
.TP
.BI -m
Force mono output.  A stereo input signal is down-mixed before encoding.
Useful if you've captured a mono signal in stereo and your player can
handle mono MPEG-1 Layer 2 audio.
.TP
.BI -e
Use CRC error protection.
.TP
.BI -V
Force VCD compatible output. The primary effect of this is to make certain that
the sampling rate is set to 44100 (-r 44100).  The VCD2.0 specifications 
permit mono audio at 64, 
96 and 192 kbits/sec and stereo at 128, 192, 224, and 384 kbits/sec. Using 
\fB-V\fP checks that the bitrate is valid for the number of channels.
The defaults (unless -m or -b are used) are stereo at 224 kbits/sec.
.TP
.BI -o \ outputpathname
The name of the output file to generate.  If '-' is given as the pathname output is written to standard output.
.SH "BUGS"
Mono output does not work for layer I.
