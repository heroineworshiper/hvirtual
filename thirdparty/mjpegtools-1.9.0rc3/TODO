Fix all the BUGS (see BUGS) of course!

TASKS OUTSTANDING

Documentation.

	- Maybe an FAQ to complement Bernhard's HOWTO 
	all those standard questions about MPEG, VCD, SVCD
	all those standard questions about busted audio drivers

Code hygiene  basically: GNU guidelines!
Basically if you want a nice example of how it should be done take
a look at the source code for vcdimager!

- A lot of the code is in fairly poor shape layout and stylistically.
	Minimally, some needs running through a C prettifier and having
	stuff like "unsigned char" replaced with appropriate types from
	stdint.h via utils/mjpeg_types.h.

- Need to test and build scripts for in-line multiplexing.

- The filtering / decimation code in the lav* utilities is now redundant
  with yuvscale in place... it should be removed once we're happy with
  yuvscale.

Major

-	Continuation of frozen encoding sessions.

- 	Try switching to the somewhat faster transposed fDCT from libavcodec.

-	"Back-up and try again" and/or "two pass" bit-allocation / quantisation 
	control on a frame by frame basis.   

Maybe sometime

- Find a proper SSE fDCT and iDCT.

- Test support for field pictures to mplex. Not urgent since for most
  sources frame pictures with field DCT/motion compensation seems to
  give better results.

- Improve the appearance of dark scenes.  At the present time dark scenes
  are very prone to splotchy or grey blockiness.  Locally reduce quantisation 
  and, if necessary, switch to a different matrix if the dark is long enough.
  The dark scenes don't use many bits anyway so its not too greedy..
