Introduction
============

The video stabilization module contains a set of functions and classes that can be used to solve the problem of video stabilization. There are a few methods implemented, most of them are descibed in the papers [OF06]_ and [G11]_. However, there are some extensions and deviations from the orginal paper methods.
