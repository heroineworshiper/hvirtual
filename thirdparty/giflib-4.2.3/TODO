= GIFLIB TODO list =

This list is short because GIFLIB is very old, very stable code with 
a very simple interface.  There are no new worlds to conquer here and
we shouldn't go looking for any, just provide a rock-solid service.

Thus: there used to be items on here about redesigning the API, but
DGifSlurp()/EGifSpew() is almost all anyone ever uses. The utilities
are historical relics mainly useful for testing, and I (ESR) don't
think we need to be competing with the likes of ImageMagick and PIL.

Accordingly, the top to-do item is...

== Remove more features ==

Get rid of the Windows-specific code unless someone documents it.

Maybe we should even drop gif2x11.  It's nice for testing, though.

== GIFLIB website ==

Do something useful with doc/GifFileType.png.

Merge the new git repository with a conversion of the old one so we have
a proper and continuous history.

== More regression tests ==

Not all the utilities have tests yet.  Idempotency checks on some of the
conversions that are invertible would be good ideas.  See the file 
tests/coverage.txt.

== Clean up the extensions mess ==

* Add a function-code argument to AddExtensionBlock()
* Remove MakeExtension() and its remaining uses in icon2gif
* Remove the Function member from the image structure

This will require a break in object-library compatibility.

like giflib's ability to do Extension code was added on at a later
time and also was not implemented entirely in conformance with the
gif89a spec.  I've hacked it further to make it conform to the spec,
but it would benefit greatly from a complete rewrite.
