== From a distribution tarball ==

Building this package from a distribtion tarball should be as simple as:

-------------------------------------------
    ./configure
    make
    cd tests; make
-------------------------------------------

The last line runs regression tests.

Note that automake currently generates Makefiles containing some GNUmake
specific syntax.  If you're having troubles building with your system
provided make, please install GNU make and try rebuilding.

Install with "make install".

== From the version-control repository ==

giflib presently uses autoconf, automake, and libtool in order to build
shared libraries for a wide variety of platforms.  The distributed tarball has
files prebuilt from these tools.  The repository does not.  If you want to
build giflib you will need to have these tools available.  

You will also need xmlto to build the derived forms of the
documentation from the DocBook-XML sources.

The build procedure is:

-------------------------------------------
   ./autogen.sh
   make
   cd tests; make
-------------------------------------------

As before, install with "make install".

== Release Procedure ==

'make dist' will create a tarball.

To do a release:

1. Check a clean tree out of the repository.

3. make dist

4. Unpack the tarball in a fresh directory.  

5. Run ./autogen.sh in the test directory to refresh the autoconf 
   generated files, then 'make' there.

6. Run the regression tests in the test directory.

7. Tag the release in the repo.

8. Ship the release tarball.

Steps 7 and 8 can be done with "make release" if you have shipper installed.

Note: the version needs to be bumped in two places, configure.ac
and lib/gif_lib.h. You will also need to stamp the top entry in the
NEWS file.  The shared-library version is also set in configure.ac.
If you are changing major versions, sync the XBS-SourceForge-Folder
attribute in the control file.
