.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool can be used to introspect or reconfigure a running PulseAudio sound server during runtime. It connects to the sound server and offers a simple live shell that can be used to enter the commands also understood in the \fIdefault.pa\f1 configuration scripts.

To exit the live shell, use ctrl+d. Note that the 'exit' command inside the shell will tell the PulseAudio daemon itself to shutdown!

If any arguments are passed on the command line, they will be passed into the live shell which will process the command and exit.
