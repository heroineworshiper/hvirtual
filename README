Running the binary:

Run ./cinelerra.sh from this directory.

There is a build of ffmpeg for use with the command line output.  This
should be put in your system path if it's desired.




Building the source:

Was last tested on Ubuntu 22 x86_64.

For GPU acceleration, it needs the proprietary Nvidia X11 drivers & CUDA
libraries.

Install the dependencies:

apt install libc6-dev g++ build-essential libz-dev texinfo libpng-dev \
libxv-dev libasound2-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev yasm cmake autoconf \
pkg-config libtool libxft-dev libxfixes-dev


Edit CUDA_DIR in configure to set your CUDA location.



Run ./configure.  Then run make.  Then run 'make install' to put it in the
bin/ directory.  Run ./cinelerra.sh in the bin/ directory.
