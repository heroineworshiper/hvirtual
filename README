Running the binary:

Run ./cinelerra.sh from this directory.

There is a build of ffmpeg for use with the command line output.  This
should be put in your system path if it's desired.




Building the source:

Was last tested on Ubuntu 24 x86_64.

For GPU acceleration, it needs the proprietary Nvidia X11 drivers & CUDA
libraries.

Install the dependencies:

```
apt install build-essential yasm cmake autoconf pkg-config libtool \
libz-dev texinfo libpng-dev libxv-dev libasound2-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev \
libxft-dev libxfixes-dev \
libglx-dev libgl-dev libxi-dev libsdl2-dev
```

Edit CUDA_DIR in configure to set your CUDA location.



Run ./configure.  Then run make.  Then run 'make install' to put it in the
bin/ directory.  Run ./cinelerra.sh in the bin/ directory.
