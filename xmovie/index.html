<H1>XMovie User's Guide</H1>

XMovie was originally written as a simple, fast method to play
uncompressed movies with stereo sound back when the only uncompressed
movie player was <B>xanim</B> and the only MPEG player was <B>MTV</B>. 
XAnim didn't play stereo sound and MTV was a $15 shareware.  Hard to
believe how today's applications toss movies around without a wimper
when just 4 years ago it was an ordeal just to play an MPEG stream.<P>

Additional codecs were added over the years.<P>

<B>OPTIONS</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>PLAY EVERY FRAME</B>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Forces every frame to be played regardless of synchronization.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>FULL SCREEN</B>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Toggles between fullscreen and windowed output.  Remember to use
the <B>f</B> key to toggle back.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>ORIGINAL SIZE</B>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Size the frame so that horizontal resolution is 1:1.
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>SYNCHRONIZE USING SOFTWARE</B>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Try to guess the synchronization instead of locking on the soundcard.  
	</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>SETTINGS</B><BR>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Display aspect ratio -</B>

	Determines the aspect ratio of the intended screen size by
stretching pixels.  Usually either 4:3 or 16:9.  Can optionally be
disabled so that pixels are always square.<P>

	<B>Letterbox aspect ratio -</B>
	
	For a letterboxed movie this determines what the movie's aspect
ratio would be if the letterbox was cropped, usually 2.2:1.  Then by
enabling <B>Crop letterbox</B> you can save CPU time and desktop area
by displaying only the part of the screen containing the movie.<P> 

	<B>Audio Priority -</B>
	
	Some people think the audio interferes with smooth video.  You can
set the nice value for the audio here.  A nice of 0 puts audio on the
same priority as video.  A nice of 20 puts audio in the lowest priority.<P>

	<B>Preload size -</B>
	
	CD-ROM drives can't handle seeking in Quicktime movies so preload
size determines a maximum number of bytes ahead of the current file
pointer the drive should read sequentially before resorting to a
SEEK_SET.  This speeds up Quicktime playback from CD-ROM drives.<P>

<A NAME="mixdown">
	<B>Downmixing strategy -</B>
	
	When playing DVD's and 6 channel audio sources you can either mix 6
channels down to stereo, send 6 discrete channels to the soundcard, or
upmix a stereo signal to 6 channels.  When you plug a 6 channel
soundcard into a home theater amplifier, the channel assignments are as
follows:

<PRE><TT>
Channel:        1         2           3           4           5            6
Speaker:    Main Left | Center | Main Right | Surr Left | Surr Right | Subwoofer
</TT></PRE>
<P>

	<B>Video device -</B>
	
	An alternative device other than X Windows can be used for video
output.<P>

An alternative was once the <A
HREF="http://digitalvideosystems.com">DVS SDStation</A>.  This is no
longer supported.<P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>AUDIO</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Selects among the audio streams.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B>VIDEO</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Selects among the video streams.  After switching video streams you should 
restart the program since not all video streams have the same dimensions.

<H1>Quicktime Info</H1>

Although not developed by Microsoft, Quicktime is really a wrapper for
the various compression standards out there with 64 bit filesystem
support.  What you know as Quicktime 4 is really the same as any other
version of Quicktime.  Quicktime 4 wraps two additional compression
standards which aren't present in the previous versions but the method
it uses for wrapping is identical to Quicktime 2.<P>

The Quicktime support in XMovie wasn't designed to play movies from the
internet.  Internet movies are encoded using the two compression
standards: Sorenson Vision and QDesign Music.  Apple licensed these
compression standards for their own use after Microsoft introduced
Windows Media Player in 1998 to avert competition, hence it is
impossible for anyone but Apple to use Sorenson Vision or QDesign
Music.<P>

Your primary use of XMovie is uncompressed Quicktime movies that you
create yourself, as in using your computer as a VCR.<P> <P>

<H1>Low bitrate MPEG Info</H1>

Be sure to disable MMX in settings->preferences.  This improves
quality.  A lot of users notice what they call "color drifting".  This
is because MMX is enabled.

<P>




<H1>DVD Info</H1>

XMovie can be used as a rudimentary DVD player by playing the IFO files
one by one.  50% of the DVD support in Linux is integrated in the
kernel.  The following kernel is known to play DVD's <P>

Kernel 2.4.4<P>


The files you want to play off of DVDs are <B>.IFO</B> files.  Each of
these is a movie.  After loading an IFO file you'll notice the time
indicator jumping around.  This shows the timecode in the MPEG stream
at every point, which on DVD's is discontinuous.<P>

Most DVD's are encoded with 6 channel audio.  If you have a 6 channel
sound card you can play all 6 channels as described <A
HREF="#mixdown">above</A>.  Otherwise downmix to stereo.<P>


<H1>MPEG transport stream info</H1>

XMovie can play transport streams downloaded from the WinTV-D card and
the reference streams from UC Berkeley.  When switching between the
HDTV and the SDTV video you need to restart the program since we don't
check for frame size changes.<P>
